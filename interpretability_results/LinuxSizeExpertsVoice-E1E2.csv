It is currently used by the ext4 and OCFS2 filesystems, but it could also be used to add journal support to other file systems or block devices such as RAID or LVM.  If you are using ext4 or OCFS2, you need to say Y here. If you are not using ext4 or OCFS2 then you will probably want to say N.  To compile this device as a module, choose M here.

DNS Resolver is used to query DNS server for information.  Examples being resolving a UNC hostname element to an IP address for CIFS or performing a DNS query for AFSDB records so that AFS can locate a cell's volume location database servers.  DNS Resolver is used by the CIFS and AFS modules, and would support SMB2 later.  DNS Resolver is supported by the userspace upcall helper /sbin/dns.resolver via /etc/request-key.conf.

E2,RANDOMIZE_BASE,"This shouldn't affect the actual kernel code size, but does affect it's placement within physical and virtual memory.  However, there may be some overhead for the physical memory usage to locate the code on a 2MB boundary. I'd be interested to know what the size impact of this is.",https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/RANDOMIZE_BASE.html,"In support of Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR), this randomizes the physical address at which the kernel image is decompressed and the virtual address where the kernel image is mapped, as a security feature that deters exploit attempts relying on knowledge of the location of kernel code internals.  On 64-bit, the kernel physical and virtual addresses are randomized separately. The physical address will be anywhere between 16MB and the top of physical memory (up to 64TB). The virtual address will be randomized from 16MB up to 1GB (9 bits of entropy). Note that this also reduces the memory space available to kernel modules from 1.5GB to 1GB.  On 32-bit, the kernel physical and virtual addresses are randomized together. They will be randomized from 16MB up to 512MB (8 bits of entropy).  Entropy is generated using the RDRAND instruction if it is supported. If RDTSC is supported, its value is mixed into the entropy pool as well. If neither RDRAND nor RDTSC are supported, then entropy is read from the i8254 timer. The usable entropy is limited by the kernel being built using 2GB addressing, and that PHYSICAL_ALIGN must be at a minimum of 2MB. As a result, only 10 bits of entropy are theoretically possible, but the implementations are further limited due to memory layouts.  If unsure, say Y."
E2,KASAN,yes.  This is a debugging feature. Adds guard pages and other items which consume memory (but are unused by correctly functioning code).,https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/KASAN.html,"Enables kernel address sanitizer - runtime memory debugger, designed to find out-of-bounds accesses and use-after-free bugs. This is strictly a debugging feature and it requires a gcc version of 4.9.2 or later. Detection of out of bounds accesses to stack or global variables requires gcc 5.0 or later. This feature consumes about 1/8 of available memory and brings about ~x3 performance slowdown. For better error detection enable CONFIG_STACKTRACE. Currently CONFIG_KASAN doesn't work with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB (the resulting kernel does not boot)."
E2,UBSAN_ALIGNMENT,don't know,https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/UBSAN_ALIGNMENT.html,This option enables detection of unaligned memory accesses. Enabling this option on architectures that support unaligned accesses may produce a lot of false positives.

Memory used would be the size of the driver.,https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/XFS_FS.html,"XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes, variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance and scalability.  Refer to the documentation at <http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/> for complete details.  This implementation is on-disk compatible with the IRIX version of XFS.  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the module will be called xfs.
