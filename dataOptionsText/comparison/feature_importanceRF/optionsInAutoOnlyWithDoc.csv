RANDOMIZE_BASE,https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/RANDOMIZE_BASE.html,,"In support of Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR), this randomizes the physical address at which the kernel image is decompressed and the virtual address where the kernel image is mapped, as a security feature that deters exploit attempts relying on knowledge of the location of kernel code internals.  On 64-bit, the kernel physical and virtual addresses are randomized separately. The physical address will be anywhere between 16MB and the top of physical memory (up to 64TB). The virtual address will be randomized from 16MB up to 1GB (9 bits of entropy). Note that this also reduces the memory space available to kernel modules from 1.5GB to 1GB.  On 32-bit, the kernel physical and virtual addresses are randomized together. They will be randomized from 16MB up to 512MB (8 bits of entropy).  Entropy is generated using the RDRAND instruction if it is supported. If RDTSC is supported, its value is mixed into the entropy pool as well. If neither RDRAND nor RDTSC are supported, then entropy is read from the i8254 timer. The usable entropy is limited by the kernel being built using 2GB addressing, and that PHYSICAL_ALIGN must be at a minimum of 2MB. As a result, only 10 bits of entropy are theoretically possible, but the implementations are further limited due to memory layouts.  If unsure, say Y."

SYN cookies provide protection against this type of attack. If you say Y here, the TCP/IP stack will use a cryptographic challenge protocol known as SYN cookies to enable legitimate users to continue to connect, even when your machine is under attack. There is no need for the legitimate users to change their TCP/IP software. SYN cookies work transparently to them. For technical information about SYN cookies, check out <http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html>.  If you are SYN flooded, the source address reported by the kernel is likely to have been forged by the attacker. it is only reported as an aid in tracing the packets to their actual source and should not be taken as absolute truth.  SYN cookies may prevent correct error reporting on clients when the server is really overloaded. If this happens frequently better turn them off.  If you say Y here, you can disable SYN cookies at run time by saying Y to /proc file system support and Sysctl support below and executing the command  echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies  after the /proc file system has been mounted.

NETFILTER,https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/NETFILTER.html,,"Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets that pass through your Linux box.  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of firewall provided by this kernel support is called a packet filter, which means that it can reject individual network packets based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall, a proxy-based one, is more secure but more intrusive and more bothersome to set up. it inspects the network traffic much more closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if you say Y here.  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without globally valid IP addresses. This is called masquerading: if one of the computers on your local network wants to send something to the outside, your box can masquerade as that computer, i.e. it forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often called NAT (Network Address Translation).  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server, typically a caching proxy server.  Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables see the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter configuration).  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see <file:Documentation/Changes> under iptables for the location of these packages."

While we cannot guarantee that it will not damage any data, we have so far not received a single report where the driver would have damaged someones data so we assume it is perfectly safe to use.  Note:  While write support is safe in this version (a rewrite from scratch of the NTFS support), it should be noted that the old NTFS write support, included in Linux 2.5.10 and before (since 1997), is not safe.  This is currently useful with TopologiLinux.  TopologiLinux is run on top of any DOS/Microsoft Windows system without partitioning your hard disk.

Note that debugging messages are disabled by default.  To enable them, supply the option debug_msgs=1 at the kernel command line when booting the kernel or as an option to insmod when loading the ntfs module.  Once the driver is active, you can enable debugging messages by doing (as root): echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug Replacing the 1 with 0 would disable debug messages.

This setting ensures that these flaws don't go unnoticed, by enabling a message, should this ever occur. This will allow people with obscure setups to know when things are going wrong, so that they might contact developers about fixing it.  Unfortunately, on some models of some architectures getting a fully seeded CRNG is extremely difficult, and so this can result in dmesg getting spammed for a surprisingly long time.  This is really bad from a security perspective, and so architecture maintainers really need to do what they can to get the CRNG seeded sooner after the system is booted. However, since users can not do anything actionble to address this, by default the kernel will issue only a single warning for the first use of unseeded randomness.

With remote DMA, you can monitor the printk buffer remotely using firescope and access all memory below 4GB using fireproxy from gdb. Even controlling a kernel debugger is possible using remote DMA.  Usage:  If ohci1394_dma=early is used as boot parameter, it will initialize all OHCI1394 controllers which are found in the PCI config space.  As all changes to the FireWire bus such as enabling and disabling devices cause a bus reset and thereby disable remote DMA for all devices, be sure to have the cable plugged and FireWire enabled on the debugging host before booting the debug target for debugging.  This code (~1k) is freed after boot. By then, the firewire stack in charge of the OHCI-1394 controllers should be used instead.  See Documentation/debugging-via-ohci1394.txt for more information."

The answer to this question won't directly affect the kernel: answering N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about advanced routing.  Note that your box can only act as a router if you enable IP forwarding in your kernel. you can do that by saying Y to /proc file system support and Sysctl support below and executing the line  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.  If you turn on IP forwarding, you should consider the rp_filter, which automatically rejects incoming packets if the routing table entry for their source address doesn't match the network interface they're arriving on. This has security advantages because it prevents the so-called IP spoofing, however it can pose problems if you use asymmetric routing (packets from you to a host take a different path than packets from that host to you) or if you operate a non-routing host which has several IP addresses on different interfaces. To turn rp_filter on use:  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<device>/rp_filter  or echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter  Note that some distributions enable it in startup scripts.

CLEANCACHE,https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/CLEANCACHE.html,,"Cleancache can be thought of as a page-granularity victim cache for clean pages that the kernel's pageframe replacement algorithm (PFRA) would like to keep around, but can't since there isn't enough memory.  So when the PFRA evicts a page, it first attempts to use cleancache code to put the data contained in that page into transcendent memory, memory that is not directly accessible or addressable by the kernel and is of unknown and possibly time-varying size.  And when a cleancache-enabled filesystem wishes to access a page in a file on disk, it first checks cleancache to see if it already contains it. if it does, the page is copied into the kernel and a disk access is avoided. When a transcendent memory driver is available (such as zcache or Xen transcendent memory), a significant I/O reduction may be achieved.  When none is available, all cleancache calls are reduced to a single pointer-compare-against-NULL resulting in a negligible performance hit.  If unsure, say Y to enable cleancache"

RAS,https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/RAS.html,,"Reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) is a computer hardware engineering term. Computers designed with higher levels of RAS have a multitude of features that protect data integrity and help them stay available for long periods of time without failure.  Reliability can be defined as the probability that the system will produce correct outputs up to some given time. Reliability is enhanced by features that help to avoid, detect and repair hardware faults.  Availability is the probability a system is operational at a given time, i.e. the amount of time a device is actually operating as the percentage of total time it should be operating.  Serviceability or maintainability is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained. if the time to repair a failed system increases, then availability will decrease.  Note that Reliability and Availability are distinct concepts: Reliability is a measure of the ability of a system to function correctly, including avoiding data corruption, whereas Availability measures how often it is available for use, even though it may not be functioning correctly. For example, a server may run forever and so have ideal availability, but may be unreliable, with frequent data corruption."

This is recommended when threaded interrupt handling is used on systems where the generation of superfluous boot interrupts cannot be disabled.  Some chipsets generate a legacy INTx boot IRQ when the IRQ entry in the chipset's IO-APIC is masked (as, e.g. the RT kernel does during interrupt handling). On chipsets where this boot IRQ generation cannot be disabled, this workaround keeps the original IRQ line masked so that only the equivalent boot IRQ is delivered to the CPUs. The workaround also tells the kernel to set up the IRQ handler on the boot IRQ line. In this way only one interrupt is delivered to the kernel.

BLK_DEV_LOOP,https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/BLK_DEV_LOOP.html,,"Saying Y here will allow you to use a regular file as a block device. you can then create a file system on that block device and mount it just as you would mount other block devices such as hard drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices are block special device files with major number 7 and typically called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device driver.  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility, found in the util-linux package, see <https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/>.  The loop device driver can also be used to hide a file system in a disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides on a remote file server.  There are several ways of encrypting disks. Some of these require kernel patches. The vanilla kernel offers the cryptoloop option and a Device Mapper target (which is superior, as it supports all file systems). If you want to use the cryptoloop, say Y to both LOOP and CRYPTOLOOP, and make sure you have a recent (version 2.12 or later) version of util-linux. Additionally, be aware that the cryptoloop is not safe for storing journaled filesystems.  Note that this loop device has nothing to do with the loopback device used for network connections from the machine to itself.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called loop.  Most users will answer N here."

WATCHDOG_HANDLE_BOOT_ENABLED,https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/WATCHDOG_HANDLE_BOOT_ENABLED.html,,"The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say Y here) is to ping watchdog devices that were enabled before the driver has been loaded until control is taken over from userspace using the /dev/watchdog file. If you say N here, the kernel will not update the watchdog on its own. Thus if your userspace does not start fast enough your device will reboot."

In short, this feature enables the kernel to report locking related deadlocks before they actually occur.  The proof does not depend on how hard and complex a deadlock scenario would be to trigger: how many participant CPUs, tasks and irq-contexts would be needed for it to trigger. The proof also does not depend on timing: if a race and a resulting deadlock is possible theoretically (no matter how unlikely the race scenario is), it will be proven so and will immediately be reported by the kernel (once the event is observed that makes the deadlock theoretically possible).  If a deadlock is impossible (i.e. the locking rules, as observed by the kernel, are mathematically correct), the kernel reports nothing.  NOTE: this feature can also be enabled for rwlocks, mutexes and rwsems - in which case all dependencies between these different locking variants are observed and mapped too, and the proof of observed correctness is also maintained for an arbitrary combination of these separate locking variants.

Like some CPUs with CPUfreq, a device may have multiple clocks. However, because the clock frequencies of a single device are determined by the single device's state, an instance of devfreq is attached to a single device and returns a representative clock frequency of the device, which is also attached to a device by 1-to-1. The device registering devfreq takes the responsibility to interpret the representative frequency and to set its every clock accordingly with the target callback given to devfreq.

IPX_INTERN,https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/IPX_INTERN.html,,"Every IPX network has an address that identifies it. Sometimes it is useful to give an IPX network address to your Linux box as well (for example if your box is acting as a file server for different IPX networks: it will then be accessible from everywhere using the same address). The way this is done is to create a virtual internal network inside your box and to assign an IPX address to this network. Say Y here if you want to do this. read the IPX-HOWTO at <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto> for details.  The full internal IPX network enables you to allocate sockets on different virtual nodes of the internal network. This is done by evaluating the field sipx_node of the socket address given to the bind call. So applications should always initialize the node field to 0 when binding a socket on the primary network. In this case the socket is assigned the default node that has been given to the kernel when the internal network was created. By enabling the full internal IPX network the cross-forwarding of packets targeted at 'special' sockets to sockets listening on the primary network is disabled. This might break existing applications, especially RIP/SAP daemons. A RIP/SAP daemon that works well with the full internal net can be found on <ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs/>.

HIBERNATION,https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/HIBERNATION.html,,"Enable the suspend to disk (STD) functionality, which is usually called hibernation in user interfaces.  STD checkpoints the system and powers it off. and restores that checkpoint on reboot.  You can suspend your machine with 'echo disk > /sys/power/state' after placing resume=/dev/swappartition on the kernel command line in your bootloader's configuration file.  Alternatively, you can use the additional userland tools available from <http://suspend.sf.net>.  In principle it does not require ACPI or APM, although for example ACPI will be used for the final steps when it is available.  One of the reasons to use software suspend is that the firmware hooks for suspend states like suspend-to-RAM (STR) often don't work very well with Linux.  It creates an image which is saved in your active swap. Upon the next boot, pass the 'resume=/dev/swappartition' argument to the kernel to have it detect the saved image, restore memory state from it, and continue to run as before. If you do not want the previous state to be reloaded, then use the 'noresume' kernel command line argument. Note, however, that fsck will be run on your filesystems and you will need to run mkswap against the swap partition used for the suspend.  It also works with swap files to a limited extent (for details see <file:Documentation/power/swsusp-and-swap-files.txt>).  Right now you may boot without resuming and resume later but in the meantime you cannot use the swap partition(s)/file(s) involved in suspending.  Also in this case you must not use the filesystems that were mounted before the suspend.  In particular, you MUST NOT MOUNT any journaled filesystems mounted before the suspend or they will get corrupted in a nasty way.  For more information take a look at <file:Documentation/power/swsusp.txt>."

This scheme has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later, however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx. the number of the pseudo terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>.

There's both a watchdog implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside your computer. For details, read <file:Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.txt> in the kernel source.  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon which is available from <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>.

CIFS was the successor to the original dialect, the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, the native file sharing mechanism for most early PC operating systems.  The SMB3 protocol is supported by most modern operating systems and NAS appliances (e.g. Samba, Windows 8, Windows 2012, MacOS). The older CIFS protocol was included in Windows NT4, 2000 and XP (and later) as well by Samba (which provides excellent CIFS and SMB3 server support for Linux and many other operating systems). Limited support for OS/2 and Windows ME and similar very old servers is provided as well.  The cifs module provides an advanced network file system client for mounting to SMB3 (and CIFS) compliant servers.  It includes support for DFS (hierarchical name space), secure per-user session establishment via Kerberos or NTLM or NTLMv2, safe distributed caching (oplock), optional packet signing, Unicode and other internationalization improvements.  In general, the default dialects, SMB3 and later, enable better performance, security and features, than would be possible with CIFS. Note that when mounting to Samba, due to the CIFS POSIX extensions, CIFS mounts can provide slightly better POSIX compatibility than SMB3 mounts. SMB2/SMB3 mount options are also slightly simpler (compared to CIFS) due to protocol improvements.  If you need to mount to Samba, Macs or Windows from this machine, say Y."

Instead of scanning the whole MTD device it only has to locate a checkpoint (called fastmap) on the device. The on-flash fastmap contains all information needed to attach the device. Using fastmap makes only sense on large devices where attaching by scanning takes long. UBI will not automatically install a fastmap on old images, but you can set the UBI module parameter fm_autoconvert to 1 if you want so. Please note that fastmap-enabled images are still usable with UBI implementations without fastmap support. On typical flash devices the whole fastmap fits into one PEB.

Switching between virtual terminals is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.  The setterm command (man setterm) can be used to change the properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal.

DRBD is a shared-nothing, synchronously replicated block device. It is designed to serve as a building block for high availability clusters and in this context, is a drop-in replacement for shared storage. Simplistically, you could see it as a network RAID 1.  Each minor device has a role, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'. On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to the local 'lower level block device' and, across the network, to the node with the device in 'secondary' state.  The secondary device simply writes the data to its lower level block device.  DRBD can also be used in dual-Primary mode (device writable on both nodes), which means it can exhibit shared disk semantics in a shared-nothing cluster.  Needless to say, on top of dual-Primary DRBD utilizing a cluster file system is necessary to maintain for cache coherency.  For automatic failover you need a cluster manager (e.g. heartbeat).

With XFree 3.9.17 preview you can use both heads if you use SVGA over fbdev or the fbdev driver on first head and the fbdev driver on second head.  If you compile it as module, two modules are created, matroxfb_crtc2 and matroxfb_maven. Matroxfb_maven is needed for both G200 and G400, matroxfb_crtc2 is needed only by G400. You must also load i2c-matroxfb to get it to run.  The driver starts in monitor mode and you must use the matroxset tool (available at <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/>) to switch it to PAL or NTSC or to swap primary and secondary head outputs.
