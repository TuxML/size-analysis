WATCHDOG_PRETIMEOUT_DEFAULT_GOV_NOOP;Use noop watchdog pretimeout governor by default. If noop governor is selected by a user, write a short message to the kernel log buffer and don't do any system changes.
CPU_FREQ;CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.  If in doubt, say N.
PHYSICAL_START;This gives the physical address where the kernel is loaded.  If kernel is a not relocatable (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n) then bzImage will decompress itself to above physical address and run from there. Otherwise, bzImage will run from the address where it has been loaded by the boot loader and will ignore above physical address.  In normal kdump cases one does not have to set/change this option as now bzImage can be compiled as a completely relocatable image (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y) and be used to load and run from a different address. This option is mainly useful for the folks who don't want to use a bzImage for capturing the crash dump and want to use a vmlinux instead. vmlinux is not relocatable hence a kernel needs to be specifically compiled to run from a specific memory area (normally a reserved region) and this option comes handy.  So if you are using bzImage for capturing the crash dump, leave the value here unchanged to 0x1000000 and set CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.  Otherwise if you plan to use vmlinux for capturing the crash dump change this value to start of the reserved region.  In other words, it can be set based on the X value as specified in the crashkernel=YM@XM command line boot parameter passed to the panic-ed kernel. Please take a look at Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt for more details about crash dumps.  Usage of bzImage for capturing the crash dump is recommended as one does not have to build two kernels. Same kernel can be used as production kernel and capture kernel. Above option should have gone away after relocatable bzImage support is introduced. But it is present because there are users out there who continue to use vmlinux for dump capture. This option should go away down the line.  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.
JOYSTICK_XPAD_LEDS;This option enables support for the LED which surrounds the Big X on XBox 360 controller.
SND_DESIGNWARE_PCM;Say Y or N if you want to add a custom ALSA extension that registers a PCM and uses PIO to transfer data.  This functionality is specially suited for I2S devices that don't have DMA support.
SENSORS_VT1211;If you say yes here then you get support for hardware monitoring features of the VIA VT1211 Super-I/O chip.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called vt1211.
CPU_FREQ_GOV_CONSERVATIVE;'conservative' - this driver is rather similar to the 'ondemand' governor both in its source code and its purpose, the difference is its optimisation for better suitability in a battery powered environment.  The frequency is gracefully increased and decreased rather than jumping to 100% when speed is required.  If you have a desktop machine then you should really be considering the 'ondemand' governor instead, however if you are using a laptop, PDA or even an AMD64 based computer (due to the unacceptable step-by-step latency issues between the minimum and maximum frequency transitions in the CPU) you will probably want to use this governor.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called cpufreq_conservative.  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpu-freq.  If in doubt, say N.
GPIO_GRGPIO;Select this to support Aeroflex Gaisler GRGPIO cores from the GRLIB VHDL IP core library.
PTP_1588_CLOCK_DTE;This driver adds support for using the Digital timing engine (DTE) in the Broadcom SoC's as a PTP clock.  The clock can be used in both wired and wireless networks for PTP purposes.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ptp_dte.

DRM_I915_SELFTEST;Choose this option to allow the driver to perform selftests upon loading. also requires the i915.selftest=1 module parameter. To exit the module after running the selftests (i.e. to prevent normal module initialisation afterwards) use i915.selftest=-1.  Recommended for driver developers only.  If in doubt, say N.
COMEDI_AMPLC_PC263_PCI;Enable support for Amplicon PCI263 relay board.  This is a PCI board with 16 reed relay output channels.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called amplc_pci263.

F2FS_FS_XATTR;Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes by the kernel or by users (see the attr(5) manual page, or visit <http://acl.bestbits.at/> for details).  If unsure, say N.
SND_AC97_POWER_SAVE;Say Y here to enable the aggressive power-saving support of AC97 codecs.  In this mode, the power-mode is dynamically controlled at each open/close.  The mode is activated by passing 'power_save=X' to the snd-ac97-codec driver module, where 'X' is the time-out value, a nonnegative integer that specifies how many seconds of idle time the driver must count before it may put the AC97 into power-save mode.  a value of 0 (zero) disables the use of this power-save mode.  After the snd-ac97-codec driver module has been loaded, the 'power_save' parameter can be set via sysfs as follows:    echo 10 > /sys/module/snd_ac97_codec/parameters/power_save  In this case, the time-out is set to 10 seconds. setting the time-out to 1 second (the minimum activation value) isn't recommended because many applications try to reopen the device frequently.  A value of 10 seconds would be a good choice for normal operations.  See Documentation/sound/alsa/powersave.txt for more details.
BLK_DEV_RAM;Saying Y here will allow you to use a portion of your RAM memory as a block device, so that you can make file systems on it, read and write to it and do all the other things that you can do with normal block devices (such as hard drives). It is usually used to load and store a copy of a minimal root file system off of a floppy into RAM during the initial install of Linux.  Note that the kernel command line option ramdisk=XX is now obsolete. For details, read <file:Documentation/blockdev/ramdisk.txt>.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called brd. An alias rd has been defined for historical reasons.  Most normal users won't need the RAM disk functionality, and can thus say N here.

SPI;The Serial Peripheral Interface is a low level synchronous protocol.  Chips that support SPI can have data transfer rates up to several tens of Mbit/sec.  Chips are addressed with a controller and a chipselect.  Most SPI slaves don't support dynamic device discovery. some are even write-only or read-only.  SPI is widely used by microcontrollers to talk with sensors, eeprom and flash memory, codecs and various other controller chips, analog to digital (and d-to-a) converters, and more. MMC and SD cards can be accessed using SPI protocol. and for DataFlash cards used in MMC sockets, SPI must always be used.  SPI is one of a family of similar protocols using a four wire interface (select, clock, data in, data out) including Microwire (half duplex), SSP, SSI, and PSP.  This driver framework should work with most such devices and controllers.
SND_CTXFI;If you want to use soundcards based on Creative Sound Blastr X-Fi boards with 20k1 or 20k2 chips, say Y here.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called snd-ctxfi.

REGULATOR_88PM8607;This driver supports 88PM8607 voltage regulator chips.
HAVE_IRQ_EXIT_ON_IRQ_STACK;Architecture doesn't only execute the irq handler on the irq stack but also irq_exit(). This way we can process softirqs on this irq stack instead of switching to a new one when we call __do_softirq() in the end of an hardirq. This spares a stack switch and improves cache usage on softirq processing.
X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_TABLE;Use built-in tables for Banias CPUs if ACPI encoding is not available.  If in doubt, say N.

This driver does not create any MTD maps itself. instead it creates MTD physmap and MTD SRAM platform devices.  If you enable this option, you should consider enabling MTD_PHYSMAP and/or MTD_PLATRAM according to the devices on your module.  When built as a module, it will be called pismo.ko
USB_OHCI_HCD_DAVINCI;Enables support for the DaVinci DA8xx integrated OHCI controller. This driver cannot currently be a loadable module because it lacks a proper PHY abstraction.
SLUB_CPU_PARTIAL;Per cpu partial caches accellerate objects allocation and freeing that is local to a processor at the price of more indeterminism in the latency of the free. On overflow these caches will be cleared which requires the taking of locks that may cause latency spikes. Typically one would choose no for a realtime system.

CALGARY_IOMMU;Support for hardware IOMMUs in IBM's xSeries x366 and x460 systems. Needed to run systems with more than 3GB of memory properly with 32-bit PCI devices that do not support DAC (Double Address Cycle). Calgary also supports bus level isolation, where all DMAs pass through the IOMMU.  This prevents them from going anywhere except their intended destination. This catches hard-to-find kernel bugs and mis-behaving drivers and devices that do not use the DMA-API properly to set up their DMA buffers.  The IOMMU can be turned off at boot time with the iommu=off parameter. Normally the kernel will make the right choice by itself. If unsure, say Y.

If unsure, say Y (since it makes it easier to find the bugs).
RTC_DRV_S5M;If you say yes here you will get support for the RTC of Samsung S2MPS14 and S5M PMIC series.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called rtc-s5m.
I2C_PCA_ISA;This driver supports ISA boards using the Philips PCA9564/PCA9665 parallel bus to I2C bus controller.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called i2c-pca-isa.  This device is almost undetectable and using this driver on a system which doesn't have this device will result in long delays when I2C/SMBus chip drivers are loaded (e.g. at boot time).

The driver supports two kinds of interface: using ledtrig-timer or through /sys/class/leds/clevo::mail/brightness. As this LED cannot change it's brightness it blinks instead. The brightness value 0 means off, 1..127 means blink at 0.5Hz and 128..255 means blink at 1Hz.  This module can drive the mail LED for the following notebooks:        Clevo D400P       Clevo D410J       Clevo D410V       Clevo D400V/D470V (not tested, but might work)       Clevo M540N       Clevo M5x0N (not tested, but might work)       Positivo Mobile (Clevo M5x0V)  If your model is not listed here you can try the nodetect module parameter.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called leds-clevo-mail.
USB_HIDDEV;Say Y here if you want to support HID devices (from the USB specification standpoint) that aren't strictly user interface devices, like monitor controls and Uninterruptable Power Supplies.  This module supports these devices separately using a separate event interface on /dev/usb/hiddevX (char 180:96 to 180:111).  If unsure, say Y.
COH901327_WATCHDOG;Say Y here to include Watchdog timer support for the watchdog embedded into the ST-Ericsson U300 series platforms. This watchdog is used to reset the system and thus cannot be compiled as a module.

NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_HL;This option adds the HL (for IPv6) and TTL (for IPv4) targets, which enable the user to change the hoplimit/time-to-live value of the IP header.  While it is safe to decrement the hoplimit/TTL value, the modules also allow to increment and set the hoplimit value of the header to arbitrary values. This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS since you can easily create immortal packets that loop forever on the network.
CLKSRC_TI_32K;This option enables support for Texas Instruments 32.768 Hz clocksource available on many OMAP-like platforms.
PCIEASPM_POWER_SUPERSAVE;Same as PCIEASPM_POWERSAVE, except it also enables L1 substates where possible. This would result in higher power savings while staying in L1 where the components support it.

Turning on this option will compile in support for DAX. you will need to mount the filesystem using the -o dax option.  If you do not have a block device that is capable of using this, or if unsure, say N.  Saying Y will increase the size of the kernel by about 5kB.
IP_VS_LBLCR;The locality-based least-connection with replication scheduling algorithm is also for destination IP load balancing. It is  usually used in cache cluster. It differs from the LBLC scheduling as follows: the load balancer maintains mappings from a target to a set of server nodes that can serve the target. Requests for a target are assigned to the least-connection node in the target's server set. If all the node in the server set are over loaded, it picks up a least-connection node in the cluster and adds it in the sever set for the target. If the server set has not been modified for the specified time, the most loaded node is removed from the server set, in order to avoid high degree of replication.  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. To compile it as a module, choose M here. If unsure, say N.
MMC_MXC;This selects the Freescale i.MX21, i.MX27, i.MX31 or MPC512x Multimedia Card Interface. If you have an i.MX or MPC512x platform with a Multimedia Card slot, say Y or M here.  If unsure, say N.

USB_SERIAL_QCAUX;Say Y here if you want to use the auxiliary serial ports provided by many modems based on Qualcomm chipsets.  These ports often use a proprietary protocol called DM and cannot be used for AT- or PPP-based communication.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called qcaux.  If unsure, choose N.
FB_STI;STI refers to the HP Standard Text Interface which is a set of BIOS routines contained in a ROM chip in HP PA-RISC based machines. Enabling this option will implement the linux framebuffer device using calls to the STI BIOS routines for initialisation.  If you enable this option, you will get a planar framebuffer device /dev/fb which will work on the most common HP graphic cards of the NGLE family, including the artist chips (in the 7xx and Bxxx series), HCRX, HCRX24, CRX, CRX24 and VisEG series.  It is safe to enable this option, so you should probably say Y.
SATA_QSTOR;This option enables support for Pacific Digital Serial ATA QStor.  If unsure, say N.

DRM_OMAP_CONNECTOR_ANALOG_TV;Driver for a generic analog TV connector.
UDF_FS;This is a file system used on some CD-ROMs and DVDs. Since the file system is supported by multiple operating systems and is more compatible with standard unix file systems, it is also suitable for removable USB disks. Say Y if you intend to mount DVD discs or CDRW's written in packet mode, or if you want to use UDF for removable USB disks. Please read <file:Documentation/filesystems/udf.txt>.  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the module will be called udf.  If unsure, say N.

SND_SGI_O2;Sound support for the SGI O2 Workstation.
FSCACHE_STATS;This option causes statistical information to be gathered on local caching and exported through file:        /proc/fs/fscache/stats  The gathering of statistics adds a certain amount of overhead to execution as there are a quite a few stats gathered, and on a multi-CPU system these may be on cachelines that keep bouncing between CPUs.  On the other hand, the stats are very useful for debugging purposes.  Saying 'Y' here is recommended.  See Documentation/filesystems/caching/fscache.txt for more information.
GPIO_MENZ127;Say yes here to support the MEN 16Z127 GPIO Controller

OCFS2_FS_O2CB;OCFS2 includes a simple kernelspace clustering package, the OCFS2 Cluster Base.  It only requires a very small userspace component to configure it. This comes with the standard ocfs2-tools package. O2CB is limited to maintaining a cluster for OCFS2 file systems. It cannot manage any other cluster applications.  It is always safe to say Y here, as the clustering method is run-time selectable.
CRYPTO_SALSA20_X86_64;Salsa20 stream cipher algorithm.  Salsa20 is a stream cipher submitted to eSTREAM, the ECRYPT Stream Cipher Project. See <http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/>  The Salsa20 stream cipher algorithm is designed by Daniel J. Bernstein <djb@cr.yp.to>. See <http://cr.yp.to/snuffle.html>
EVENTFD;Enable the eventfd() system call that allows to receive both kernel notification (ie. KAIO) or userspace notifications.  If unsure, say Y.
EDAC_ALTERA_USB;Support for error detection and correction on the Altera USB FIFO Memory for Altera SoCs.

BLK_DEV_SD;If you want to use SCSI hard disks, Fibre Channel disks, Serial ATA (SATA) or Parallel ATA (PATA) hard disks, USB storage or the SCSI or parallel port version of the IOMEGA ZIP drive, say Y and read the SCSI-HOWTO, the Disk-HOWTO and the Multi-Disk-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. This is NOT for SCSI CD-ROMs.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read <file:Documentation/scsi/scsi.txt>. The module will be called sd_mod.  Do not compile this driver as a module if your root file system (the one containing the directory /) is located on a SCSI disk. In this case, do not compile the driver for your SCSI host adapter (below) as a module either.
COMEDI_SSV_DNP;Enable support for SSV Embedded Systems DIL/Net-PC  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ssv_dnp.

APM;APM is a BIOS specification for saving power using several different techniques. This is mostly useful for battery powered laptops with APM compliant BIOSes. If you say Y here, the system time will be reset after a RESUME operation, the /proc/apm device will provide battery status information, and user-space programs will receive notification of APM events (e.g. battery status change).  If you select Y here, you can disable actual use of the APM BIOS by passing the apm=off option to the kernel at boot time.  Note that the APM support is almost completely disabled for machines with more than one CPU.  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location and more information, read <file:Documentation/power/apm-acpi.txt> and the Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8) manpage (man 8 hdparm) for that), and it doesn't turn off VESA-compliant green monitors.  This driver does not support the TI 4000M TravelMate and the ACER 486/DX4/75 because they don't have compliant BIOSes. Many green desktop machines also don't have compliant BIOSes, and this driver may cause those machines to panic during the boot phase.  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't much point in using this driver and you should say N. If you get random kernel OOPSes or reboots that don't seem to be related to anything, try disabling/enabling this option (or disabling/enabling APM in your BIOS).  Some other things you should try when experiencing seemingly random, weird problems:  1) make sure that you have enough swap space and that it is enabled. 2) pass the no-hlt option to the kernel 3) switch on floating point emulation in the kernel and pass the no387 option to the kernel 4) pass the floppy=nodma option to the kernel 5) pass the mem=4M option to the kernel (thereby disabling all but the first 4 MB of RAM) 6) make sure that the CPU is not over clocked. 7) read the sig11 FAQ at <http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/> 8) disable the cache from your BIOS settings 9) install a fan for the video card or exchange video RAM 10) install a better fan for the CPU 11) exchange RAM chips 12) exchange the motherboard.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called apm.
COMEDI_BOND;Enable support for a driver to 'bond' (merge) multiple subdevices from multiple devices together as one.  Currently, it only handles digital I/O subdevices.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called comedi_bond.
SND_HDA_CODEC_CONEXANT;Say Y or M here to include Conexant HD-audio codec support in snd-hda-intel driver, such as CX20549.
SERIAL_8250_CS;Say Y here to enable support for 16-bit PCMCIA serial devices, including serial port cards, modems, and the modem functions of multi-function Ethernet/modem cards. (PCMCIA- or PC-cards are credit-card size devices often used with laptops.)  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called serial_cs.  If unsure, say N.
LTC2497;Say yes here to build support for Linear Technology LTC2497 16-Bit 8-/16-Channel Delta Sigma ADC.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ltc2497.
USB_EHCI_HCD_PPC_OF;Enables support for the USB controller present on the PowerPC OpenFirmware platform bus.
ASYNC_TX_DMA;This allows the async_tx api to take advantage of offload engines for memcpy, memset, xor, and raid6 p+q operations.  If your platform has a dma engine that can perform raid operations and you have enabled MD_RAID456 say Y.  If unsure, say N.
INTEGRITY_TRUSTED_KEYRING;This option requires that all keys added to the .ima and .evm keyrings be signed by a key on the system trusted keyring.
DEV_DAX_PMEM;Support raw access to persistent memory.  Note that this driver consumes memory ranges allocated and exported by the libnvdimm sub-system.  Say Y if unsure
DVB_CX22702;A DVB-T tuner module. Say Y when you want to support this frontend.
SQUASHFS_LZ4;Saying Y here includes support for reading Squashfs file systems compressed with LZ4 compression.  LZ4 compression is mainly aimed at embedded systems with slower CPUs where the overheads of zlib are too high.  LZ4 is not the standard compression used in Squashfs and so most file systems will be readable without selecting this option.  If unsure, say N.
DVB_CX22700;A DVB-T tuner module. Say Y when you want to support this frontend.
THERMAL_GOV_POWER_ALLOCATOR;Enable this to manage platform thermals by dynamically allocating and limiting power to devices.
BLK_DEV_LOOP;Saying Y here will allow you to use a regular file as a block device. you can then create a file system on that block device and mount it just as you would mount other block devices such as hard drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices are block special device files with major number 7 and typically called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device driver.  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility, found in the util-linux package, see <https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/>.  The loop device driver can also be used to hide a file system in a disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides on a remote file server.  There are several ways of encrypting disks. Some of these require kernel patches. The vanilla kernel offers the cryptoloop option and a Device Mapper target (which is superior, as it supports all file systems). If you want to use the cryptoloop, say Y to both LOOP and CRYPTOLOOP, and make sure you have a recent (version 2.12 or later) version of util-linux. Additionally, be aware that the cryptoloop is not safe for storing journaled filesystems.  Note that this loop device has nothing to do with the loopback device used for network connections from the machine to itself.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called loop.  Most users will answer N here.
FB_KYRO;Say Y here if you have a STG4000 / Kyro / PowerVR 3 based graphics board.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called kyrofb.

USB_SERIAL_BELKIN;Say Y here if you want to use a Belkin USB Serial single port adaptor (F5U103 is one of the model numbers) or the Peracom single port USB to serial adapter.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called belkin_sa.
SCSI_DH_RDAC;If you have a LSI RDAC select y. Otherwise, say N.
RTLWIFI_DEBUG;To use the module option that sets the dynamic-debugging level for, the front-end driver, this parameter must be Y. For memory-limited systems, choose N. If in doubt, choose Y.
DRM_TILCDC_SLAVE_COMPAT;Choose this option if you need a kernel that is compatible with device tree blobs using the obsolete ti,tilcdc,slave binding. If you find ti,tilcdc,slave-string from your DTB, you probably need this. Otherwise you do not.
IBM_ASM;This option enables device driver support for in-band access to the IBM RSA (Condor) service processor in eServer xSeries systems. The ibmasm device driver allows user space application to access ASM (Advanced Systems Management) functions on the service processor. The driver is meant to be used in conjunction with a user space API. The ibmasm driver also enables the OS to use the UART on the service processor board as a regular serial port. To make use of this feature serial driver support (CONFIG_SERIAL_8250) must be enabled.  WARNING: This software may not be supported or function correctly on your IBM server. Please consult the IBM ServerProven website <http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/info/x86servers/serverproven/compat/us/> for information on the specific driver level and support statement for your IBM server.

HISAX_DIEHLDIVA;This enables HiSax support for the Eicon.Diehl Diva none PRO versions passive ISDN cards.  See <file:Documentation/isdn/README.HiSax> on how to configure it using the different cards, a different D-channel protocol, or non-standard IRQ/port settings.
ISDN_PPP;Over digital connections such as ISDN, there is no need to synchronize sender and recipient's clocks with start and stop bits as is done over analog telephone lines. Instead, one can use synchronous PPP. Saying Y here will include this protocol. This protocol is used by Cisco and Sun for example. So you want to say Y here if the other end of your ISDN connection supports it. You will need a special version of pppd (called ipppd) for using this feature. See <file:Documentation/isdn/README.syncppp> and <file:Documentation/isdn/syncPPP.FAQ> for more information.
IP6_NF_NAT;This enables the `nat' table in ip6tables. This allows masquerading, port forwarding and other forms of full Network Address Port Translation.  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
MOUSE_PS2_TRACKPOINT;Say Y here if you have an IBM Trackpoint PS/2 mouse connected to your system.  If unsure, say Y.
MSNDCLAS_INIT_FILE;The MultiSound cards have two firmware files which are required for operation, and are not currently included. These files can be obtained from Turtle Beach. See <file:Documentation/sound/oss/MultiSound> for information on how to obtain this.
GPIO_104_DIO_48E;Enables GPIO support for the ACCES 104-DIO-48E series (104-DIO-48E, 104-DIO-24E). The base port addresses for the devices may be configured via the base module parameter. The interrupt line numbers for the devices may be configured via the irq module parameter.

SERIAL_8250_MOXA;Say Y here if you have a Moxa SmartIO MUE multiport serial card. If unsure, say N.  This driver can also be built as a module. The module will be called 8250_moxa. If you want to do that, say M here.
ZSWAP;A lightweight compressed cache for swap pages.  It takes pages that are in the process of being swapped out and attempts to compress them into a dynamically allocated RAM-based memory pool. This can result in a significant I/O reduction on swap device and, in the case where decompressing from RAM is faster that swap device reads, can also improve workload performance.  This is marked experimental because it is a new feature (as of v3.11) that interacts heavily with memory reclaim.  While these interactions don't cause any known issues on simple memory setups, they have not be fully explored on the large set of potential configurations and workloads that exist.
SOUND_MPU401;Be careful with this question.  The MPU401 interface is supported by all sound cards.  However, some natively supported cards have their own driver for MPU401.  Enabling this MPU401 option with these cards will cause a conflict.  Also, enabling MPU401 on a system that doesn't really have a MPU401 could cause some trouble.  If your card was in the list of supported cards, look at the card specific instructions in the <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS> file.  It is safe to answer Y if you have a true MPU401 MIDI interface card.  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add mpu401=<io>,<irq> to the kernel command line.
CAN_PEAK_PCIEC;Say Y here if you want to use a PCAN-ExpressCard from PEAK-System Technik. This will also automatically select I2C and I2C_ALGO configuration options.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called cpcihp_generic.  When in doubt, say N.
NET_VENDOR_SGI;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about SGI devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
UEVENT_HELPER_PATH;To disable user space helper program execution at by default specify an empty string here. This setting can still be altered via /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug or via /sys/kernel/uevent_helper later at runtime.
IP_VS_SH_TAB_BITS;The source hashing scheduler maps source IPs to destinations stored in a hash table. This table is tiled by each destination until all slots in the table are filled. When using weights to allow destinations to receive more connections, the table is tiled an amount proportional to the weights specified. The table needs to be large enough to effectively fit all the destinations multiplied by their respective weights.
SERIAL_AR933X_CONSOLE;Enable a built-in UART port of the AR933X to be the system console.

SQUASHFS_LZO;Saying Y here includes support for reading Squashfs file systems compressed with LZO compression.  LZO compression is mainly aimed at embedded systems with slower CPUs where the overheads of zlib are too high.  LZO is not the standard compression used in Squashfs and so most file systems will be readable without selecting this option.  If unsure, say N.
UNIPHIER_SYSTEM_BUS;Support for UniPhier System Bus, a simple external bus.  This is needed to use on-board devices connected to UniPhier SoCs.
IP_VS_PE_SIP;Allow persistence based on the SIP Call-ID

LAPBETHER;Driver for a pseudo device (typically called /dev/lapb0) which allows you to open an LAPB point-to-point connection to some other computer on your Ethernet network.  In order to do this, you need to say Y or M to the driver for your Ethernet card as well as to LAPB Data Link Driver.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called lapbether.  If unsure, say N.
MAC80211_MESH_PS_DEBUG;Selecting this option causes mac80211 to print out very verbose mesh powersave debugging messages (when mac80211 is taking part in a mesh network).  Do not select this option.
X86_PPRO_FENCE;Old PentiumPro multiprocessor systems had errata that could cause memory operations to violate the x86 ordering standard in rare cases. Enabling this option will attempt to work around some (but not all) occurrences of this problem, at the cost of much heavier spinlock and memory barrier operations.  If unsure, say n here. Even distro kernels should think twice before enabling this: there are few systems, and an unlikely bug.
CRYPTO_FIPS;This options enables the fips boot option which is required if you want to system to operate in a FIPS 200 certification.  You should say no unless you know what this is.
DRM_SIS;Choose this option if you have a SiS 630 or compatible video chipset. If M is selected the module will be called sis. AGP support is required for this driver to work.

FSCACHE_DEBUG;This permits debugging to be dynamically enabled in the local caching management module.  If this is set, the debugging output may be enabled by setting bits in /sys/modules/fscache/parameter/debug.  See Documentation/filesystems/caching/fscache.txt for more information.
SH_CPU_FREQ;This adds the cpufreq driver for SuperH. Any CPU that supports clock rate rounding through the clock framework can use this driver. While it will make the kernel slightly larger, this is harmless for CPUs that don't support rate rounding. The driver will also generate a notice in the boot log before disabling itself if the CPU in question is not capable of rate rounding.  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.  If unsure, say N.

The PMIC provides ADC, GPIO, thermal, charger and related power management functions on these systems.  This option is a bool as it provides an ACPI OpRegion which must be available before any devices using it are probed. This option also causes the designware-i2c driver to be builtin for the same reason.
USERFAULTFD;Enable the userfaultfd() system call that allows to intercept and handle page faults in userland.
ATA_SFF;This option adds support for ATA controllers with SFF compliant or similar programming interface.  SFF is the legacy IDE interface that has been around since the dawn of time.  Almost all PATA controllers have an SFF interface.  Many SATA controllers have an SFF interface when configured into a legacy compatibility mode.  For users with exclusively modern controllers like AHCI, Silicon Image 3124, or Marvell 6440, you may choose to disable this unneeded SFF support.  If unsure, say Y.
ACPI_PROCFS_POWER;For backwards compatibility, this option allows deprecated power /proc/acpi/ directories to exist, even when they have been replaced by functions in /sys. The deprecated directories (and their replacements) include: /proc/acpi/battery/* (/sys/class/power_supply/*) /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/* (sys/class/power_supply/*) This option has no effect on /proc/acpi/ directories and functions, which do not yet exist in /sys This option, together with the proc directories, will be deleted in the future.  Say N to delete power /proc/acpi/ directories that have moved to /sys/

Secondary head is not compatible with accelerated XFree 3.3.x SVGA servers - secondary head output is blanked while you are in X. With XFree 3.9.17 preview you can use both heads if you use SVGA over fbdev or the fbdev driver on first head and the fbdev driver on second head.  If you compile it as module, two modules are created, matroxfb_crtc2 and matroxfb_maven. Matroxfb_maven is needed for both G200 and G400, matroxfb_crtc2 is needed only by G400. You must also load i2c-matroxfb to get it to run.  The driver starts in monitor mode and you must use the matroxset tool (available at <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/>) to switch it to PAL or NTSC or to swap primary and secondary head outputs. Secondary head driver also always start in 640x480 resolution, you must use fbset to change it.  Also do not forget that second head supports only 16 and 32 bpp packed pixels, so it is a good idea to compile them into the kernel too.  You can use only some font widths, as the driver uses generic painting procedures (the secondary head does not use acceleration engine).
IP6_NF_IPTABLES;ip6tables is a general, extensible packet identification framework. Currently only the packet filtering and packet mangling subsystem for IPv6 use this, but connection tracking is going to follow. Say 'Y' or 'M' here if you want to use either of those.

CRYPTO_RMD320;RIPEMD-320 is an optional extension of RIPEMD-160 with a 320 bit hash. It is intended for applications that require longer hash-results, without needing a larger security level (than RIPEMD-160).  Developed by Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers and Bart Preneel. See <http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bosselae/ripemd160.html>
DEBUG_DEVRES;This option enables kernel parameter devres.log. If set to non-zero, devres debug messages are printed. Select this if you are having a problem with devres or want to debug resource management for a managed device. devres.log can be switched on and off from sysfs node.  If you are unsure about this, Say N here.
SOUND_OSS_CORE_PRECLAIM;With this option enabled, the kernel will claim all OSS device numbers if any OSS support (native or emulation) is enabled whether the respective module is loaded or not and try to load the appropriate module using sound-slot/service-* and char-major-* module aliases when one of the device numbers is opened.  With this option disabled, kernel will only claim actually in-use device numbers and opening a missing device will generate only the standard char-major-* aliases.  The only visible difference is use of additional module aliases and whether OSS sound devices appear multiple times in /proc/devices.  sound-slot/service-* module aliases are scheduled to be removed (ie. PRECLAIM won't be available) and this option is to make the transition easier.  This option can be overridden during boot using the kernel parameter soundcore.preclaim_oss.  Disabling this allows alternative OSS implementations.  If unsure, say Y.
USB_SERIAL_KEYSPAN_USA49W;Say Y here to include firmware for the USA-49W converter.

TEGRA20_APB_DMA;Support for the NVIDIA Tegra20 APB DMA controller driver. The DMA controller is having multiple DMA channel which can be configured for different peripherals like audio, UART, SPI, I2C etc which is in APB bus. This DMA controller transfers data from memory to peripheral fifo or vice versa. It does not support memory to memory data transfer.
HVC_XEN;Xen virtual console device driver
HP_SDC;This option enables support for the System Device Controller, an i8042 carrying microcode to manage a few miscellaneous devices on some Hewlett Packard systems. The SDC itself contains a 10ms resolution timer/clock capable of delivering interrupts on a periodic and one-shot basis. The SDC may also be connected to a battery-backed real-time clock, a basic audio waveform generator, and an HP-HIL Master Link Controller serving up to seven input devices.  By itself this option is rather useless, but enabling it will enable selection of drivers for the abovementioned devices. It is, however, incompatible with the old, reliable HIL keyboard driver, and the new HIL driver is experimental, so if you plan to use a HIL keyboard as your primary keyboard, you may wish to keep using that driver until the new HIL drivers have had more testing.
DMI;Enabled scanning of DMI to identify machine quirks. Say Y here unless you have verified that your setup is not affected by entries in the DMI blacklist. Required by PNP BIOS code.

BINFMT_ELF_FDPIC;ELF FDPIC binaries are based on ELF, but allow the individual load segments of a binary to be located in memory independently of each other. This makes this format ideal for use in environments where no MMU is available as it still permits text segments to be shared, even if data segments are not.  It is also possible to run FDPIC ELF binaries on MMU linux also.
FB_ARMCLCD;This framebuffer device driver is for the ARM PrimeCell PL110 Colour LCD controller.  ARM PrimeCells provide the building blocks for System on a Chip devices.

HAVE_C_RECORDMCOUNT;C version of recordmcount available?
CORTINA_PHY;Currently supports the CS4340 phy.
CPU_FREQ_GOV_SCHEDUTIL;This governor makes decisions based on the utilization data provided by the scheduler.  It sets the CPU frequency to be proportional to the utilization/capacity ratio coming from the scheduler.  If the utilization is frequency-invariant, the new frequency is also proportional to the maximum available frequency.  If that is not the case, it is proportional to the current frequency of the CPU.  The frequency tipping point is at utilization/capacity equal to 80% in both cases.  If in doubt, say N.
IEEE802154_MRF24J40;Say Y here to enable the MRF24J20 SPI 802.15.4 wireless controller.  This driver can also be built as a module. To do so, say M here. the module will be called 'mrf24j40'.
DYNAMIC_FTRACE;This option will modify all the calls to function tracing dynamically (will patch them out of the binary image and replace them with a No-Op instruction) on boot up. During compile time, a table is made of all the locations that ftrace can function trace, and this table is linked into the kernel image. When this is enabled, functions can be individually enabled, and the functions not enabled will not affect performance of the system.  See the files in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing:   available_filter_functions   set_ftrace_filter   set_ftrace_notrace  This way a CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER kernel is slightly larger, but otherwise has native performance as long as no tracing is active.
NFC_MRVL;The core driver to support Marvell NFC devices.  This driver is required if you want to support Marvell NFC device 8897.
USB_LINK_LAYER_TEST;This driver is for generating specific traffic for Super Speed Link Layer Test Device. Say Y only when you want to conduct USB Super Speed Link Layer Test for host controllers.

It also supports the legacy style of driver binding.  To use that with some chips which don't replicate LM75 quirks exactly, you may need the force module parameter.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called lm75.
FB_PS3_DEFAULT_SIZE_M;This is the default size (in MiB) of the virtual frame buffer in the PS3. The default value can be overridden on the kernel command line using the ps3fb option (e.g. ps3fb=9M).

NET_VENDOR_FARADAY;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about Faraday cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
RTC_INTF_DEV;Say yes here if you want to use your RTCs using the /dev interfaces, which udev sets up as /dev/rtc0 through /dev/rtcN.  You may want to set up a symbolic link so one of these can be accessed as /dev/rtc, which is a name expected by hwclock and some other programs. Recent versions of udev are known to set up the symlink for you.  If unsure, say Y.
SQUASHFS_4K_DEVBLK_SIZE;By default Squashfs sets the dev block size (sb_min_blocksize) to 1K or the smallest block size supported by the block device (if larger).  This, because blocks are packed together and unaligned in Squashfs, should reduce latency.  This, however, gives poor performance on MTD NAND devices where the optimal I/O size is 4K (even though the devices can support smaller block sizes).  Using a 4K device block size may also improve overall I/O performance for some file access patterns (e.g. sequential accesses of files in filesystem order) on all media.  Setting this option will force Squashfs to use a 4K device block size by default.  If unsure, say N.
CRYPTO_MCRYPTD;This is a generic software asynchronous crypto daemon that provides the kernel thread to assist multi-buffer crypto algorithms for submitting jobs and flushing jobs in multi-buffer crypto algorithms.  Multi-buffer crypto algorithms are executed in the context of this kernel thread and drivers can post their crypto request asynchronously to be processed by this daemon.
ISDN_I4L;This driver allows you to use an ISDN adapter for networking connections and as dialin/out device.  The isdn-tty's have a built in AT-compatible modem emulator.  Network devices support autodial, channel-bundling, callback and caller-authentication without having a daemon running.  A reduced T.70 protocol is supported with tty's suitable for German BTX.  On D-Channel, the protocols EDSS1 (Euro-ISDN) and 1TR6 (German style) are supported.  See <file:Documentation/isdn/README> for more information.  ISDN support in the linux kernel is moving towards a new API, called CAPI (Common ISDN Application Programming Interface). Therefore the old ISDN4Linux layer will eventually become obsolete. It is still available, though, for use with adapters that are not supported by the new CAPI subsystem yet.

EFI_MIXED;Enabling this feature allows a 64-bit kernel to be booted on a 32-bit firmware, provided that your CPU supports 64-bit mode.  Note that it is not possible to boot a mixed-mode enabled kernel via the EFI boot stub - a bootloader that supports the EFI handover protocol must be used.  If unsure, say N.
SND_PXA2XX_SOC_MAGICIAN;Say Y if you want to add support for SoC audio on the HTC Magician.
DEFAULT_HUNG_TASK_TIMEOUT;This option controls the default timeout (in seconds) used to determine when a task has become non-responsive and should be considered hung.  It can be adjusted at runtime via the kernel.hung_task_timeout_secs sysctl or by writing a value to /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs.  A timeout of 0 disables the check.  The default is two minutes. Keeping the default should be fine in most cases.

UML_RANDOM;This option enables UML's hardware random number generator.  It attaches itself to the host's /dev/random, supplying as much entropy as the host has, rather than the small amount the UML gets from its own drivers.  It registers itself as a standard hardware random number generator, major 10, minor 183, and the canonical device name is /dev/hwrng. The way to make use of this is to install the rng-tools package (check your distro, or download from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/).  rngd periodically reads /dev/hwrng and injects the entropy into /dev/random.
SCLP_ASYNC;This option enables the call home function, which is able to inform the service element and connected organisations about a kernel panic. You should only select this option if you know what you are doing, want for inform other people about your kernel panics, need this feature and intend to run your kernel in LPAR.

Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about  cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC;Unmap pages from the kernel linear mapping after free_pages(). Depending on runtime enablement, this results in a small or large slowdown, but helps to find certain types of memory corruption.  For architectures which don't enable ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, fill the pages with poison patterns after free_pages() and verify the patterns before alloc_pages().  Additionally, this option cannot be enabled in combination with hibernation as that would result in incorrect warnings of memory corruption after a resume because free pages are not saved to the suspend image.  By default this option will have a small overhead, e.g. by not allowing the kernel mapping to be backed by large pages on some architectures. Even bigger overhead comes when the debugging is enabled by DEBUG_PAGEALLOC_ENABLE_DEFAULT or the debug_pagealloc command line parameter.
DEBUG_BLOCK_EXT_DEVT;BIG FAT WARNING: ENABLING THIS OPTION MIGHT BREAK BOOTING ON SOME DISTRIBUTIONS.  DO NOT ENABLE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.  Distros, please enable this and fix whatever is broken.  Conventionally, block device numbers are allocated from predetermined contiguous area.  However, extended block area may introduce non-contiguous block device numbers.  This option forces most block device numbers to be allocated from the extended space and spreads them to discover kernel or userland code paths which assume predetermined contiguous device number allocation.  Note that turning on this debug option shuffles all the device numbers for all IDE and SCSI devices including libata ones, so root partition specified using device number directly (via rdev or root=MAJ:MIN) won't work anymore. Textual device names (root=/dev/sdXn) will continue to work.  Say N if you are unsure.
SERIAL_SUNSU;This driver supports the 8250 serial ports that run the keyboard and mouse on (PCI) UltraSPARC systems.  Say Y or M if you want to be able to these serial ports.
SND_OMAP_SOC_HDMI_AUDIO;For HDMI audio to work OMAPDSS HDMI support should be enabled. The hdmi audio driver implements cpu-dai component using the callbacks provided by OMAPDSS and registers the component under DSS HDMI device. Omap-pcm is registered for platform component also under DSS HDMI device. Dummy codec is used as as codec component. The hdmi audio driver implements also the card and registers it under its own platform device. The device for the driver is registered by OMAPDSS hdmi driver.
GLOB_SELFTEST;This option enables a simple self-test of the glob_match function on startup.  It is primarily useful for people working on the code to ensure they haven't introduced any regressions.  It only adds a little bit of code and slows kernel boot (or module load) by a small amount, so you're welcome to play with it, but you probably don't need it.
VIDEO_CX88_DVB;This adds support for DVB/ATSC cards based on the Conexant 2388x chip.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called cx88-dvb.

ARCNET_CAP;ARCnet cap mode packet encapsulation. Used to get the hardware acknowledge back to userspace. After the initial protocol byte every packet is stuffed with an extra 4 byte cookie which doesn't actually appear on the network. After transmit the driver will send back a packet with protocol byte 0 containing the status of the transmission:    0=no hardware acknowledge    1=excessive nak    2=transmission accepted by the receiver hardware  Received packets are also stuffed with the extra 4 bytes but it will be random data.  Cap only listens to protocol 1-8.
PINCTRL_IMX50;Say Y here to enable the imx50 pinctrl driver
HID_KYE;Support for KYE/Genius devices not fully compliant with HID standard: - Ergo Mouse - EasyPen i405X tablet - MousePen i608X tablet - EasyPen M610X tablet

AIC7XXX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE;Specify the number of commands you would like to allocate per SCSI device when Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is enabled on that device.  This is an upper bound value for the number of tagged transactions to be used for any device.  The aic7xxx driver will automatically vary this number based on device behavior.  For devices with a fixed maximum, the driver will eventually lock to this maximum and display a console message indicating this value.  Due to resource allocation issues in the Linux SCSI mid-layer, using a high number of commands per device may result in memory allocation failures when many devices are attached to the system.  For this reason, the default is set to 32.  Higher values may result in higher performance on some devices.  The upper bound is 253.  0 disables tagged queueing.  Per device tag depth can be controlled via the kernel command line tag_info option.  See Documentation/scsi/aic7xxx.txt for details.

VFIO_NOIOMMU;VFIO is built on the ability to isolate devices using the IOMMU. Only with an IOMMU can userspace access to DMA capable devices be considered secure.  VFIO No-IOMMU mode enables IOMMU groups for devices without IOMMU backing for the purpose of re-using the VFIO infrastructure in a non-secure mode.  Use of this mode will result in an unsupportable kernel and will therefore taint the kernel. Device assignment to virtual machines is also not possible with this mode since there is no IOMMU to provide DMA translation.  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

PROVE_LOCKING;This feature enables the kernel to prove that all locking that occurs in the kernel runtime is mathematically correct: that under no circumstance could an arbitrary (and not yet triggered) combination of observed locking sequences (on an arbitrary number of CPUs, running an arbitrary number of tasks and interrupt contexts) cause a deadlock.  In short, this feature enables the kernel to report locking related deadlocks before they actually occur.  The proof does not depend on how hard and complex a deadlock scenario would be to trigger: how many participant CPUs, tasks and irq-contexts would be needed for it to trigger. The proof also does not depend on timing: if a race and a resulting deadlock is possible theoretically (no matter how unlikely the race scenario is), it will be proven so and will immediately be reported by the kernel (once the event is observed that makes the deadlock theoretically possible).  If a deadlock is impossible (i.e. the locking rules, as observed by the kernel, are mathematically correct), the kernel reports nothing.  NOTE: this feature can also be enabled for rwlocks, mutexes and rwsems - in which case all dependencies between these different locking variants are observed and mapped too, and the proof of observed correctness is also maintained for an arbitrary combination of these separate locking variants.  For more details, see Documentation/locking/lockdep-design.txt.

In addition the debug information is also compressed.  Requires recent gcc (4.7+) and recent gdb/binutils. Any tool that packages or reads debug information would need to know about the .dwo files and include them. Incompatible with older versions of ccache.

RANDOMIZE_BASE;In support of Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR), this randomizes the physical address at which the kernel image is decompressed and the virtual address where the kernel image is mapped, as a security feature that deters exploit attempts relying on knowledge of the location of kernel code internals.  On 64-bit, the kernel physical and virtual addresses are randomized separately. The physical address will be anywhere between 16MB and the top of physical memory (up to 64TB). The virtual address will be randomized from 16MB up to 1GB (9 bits of entropy). Note that this also reduces the memory space available to kernel modules from 1.5GB to 1GB.  On 32-bit, the kernel physical and virtual addresses are randomized together. They will be randomized from 16MB up to 512MB (8 bits of entropy).  Entropy is generated using the RDRAND instruction if it is supported. If RDTSC is supported, its value is mixed into the entropy pool as well. If neither RDRAND nor RDTSC are supported, then entropy is read from the i8254 timer. The usable entropy is limited by the kernel being built using 2GB addressing, and that PHYSICAL_ALIGN must be at a minimum of 2MB. As a result, only 10 bits of entropy are theoretically possible, but the implementations are further limited due to memory layouts.  If unsure, say Y.

IPX_INTERN;Every IPX network has an address that identifies it. Sometimes it is useful to give an IPX network address to your Linux box as well (for example if your box is acting as a file server for different IPX networks: it will then be accessible from everywhere using the same address). The way this is done is to create a virtual internal network inside your box and to assign an IPX address to this network. Say Y here if you want to do this. read the IPX-HOWTO at <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto> for details.  The full internal IPX network enables you to allocate sockets on different virtual nodes of the internal network. This is done by evaluating the field sipx_node of the socket address given to the bind call. So applications should always initialize the node field to 0 when binding a socket on the primary network. In this case the socket is assigned the default node that has been given to the kernel when the internal network was created. By enabling the full internal IPX network the cross-forwarding of packets targeted at 'special' sockets to sockets listening on the primary network is disabled. This might break existing applications, especially RIP/SAP daemons. A RIP/SAP daemon that works well with the full internal net can be found on <ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs/>.  If you don't know what you are doing, say N.

While this is useful for debugging, it's also a security threat - your keypresses include your passwords, of course.  If unsure, say N.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called evbug.
IMA_KEYRINGS_PERMIT_SIGNED_BY_BUILTIN_OR_SECONDARY;Keys may be added to the IMA or IMA blacklist keyrings, if the key is validly signed by a CA cert in the system built-in or secondary trusted keyrings.

FB_TILEBLITTING;This enables tile blitting.  Tile blitting is a drawing technique where the screen is divided into rectangular sections (tiles), whereas the standard blitting divides the screen into pixels. Because the default drawing element is a tile, drawing functions will be passed parameters in terms of number of tiles instead of number of pixels. For example, to draw a single character, instead of using bitmaps, an index to an array of bitmaps will be used.  To clear or move a rectangular section of a screen, the rectangle will be described in terms of number of tiles in the x- and y-axis.  This is particularly important to one driver, matroxfb.  If unsure, say N.

HWLAT_TRACER;This tracer, when enabled will create one or more kernel threads, depening on what the cpumask file is set to, which each thread spinning in a loop looking for interruptions caused by something other than the kernel. For example, if a System Management Interrupt (SMI) takes a noticeable amount of time, this tracer will detect it. This is useful for testing if a system is reliable for Real Time tasks.  Some files are created in the tracing directory when this is enabled:    hwlat_detector/width   - time in usecs for how long to spin for   hwlat_detector/window  - time in usecs between the start of each                             iteration  A kernel thread is created that will spin with interrupts disabled for width microseconds in every widow cycle. It will not spin for window - width microseconds, where the system can continue to operate.  The output will appear in the trace and trace_pipe files.  When the tracer is not running, it has no affect on the system, but when it is running, it can cause the system to be periodically non responsive. Do not run this tracer on a production system.  To enable this tracer, echo in hwlat into the current_tracer file. Every time a latency is greater than tracing_thresh, it will be recorded into the ring buffer.

PCI_HOST_GENERIC;Say Y here if you want to support a simple generic PCI host controller, such as the one emulated by kvmtool.
VFAT_FS;This option provides support for normal Windows file systems with long filenames.  That includes non-compressed FAT-based file systems used by Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0, and the Unix programs from the mtools package.  The VFAT support enlarges your kernel by about 10 KB and it only works if you said Y to the DOS FAT fs support above.  Please read the file <file:Documentation/filesystems/vfat.txt> for details.  If unsure, say Y.  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called vfat.
NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_ECN;This option adds an ECN match, which allows you to match against the IPv4 and TCP header ECN fields.  To compile it as a module, choose M here. If unsure, say N.

MTD_UBI_BEB_LIMIT;This option specifies the maximum bad physical eraseblocks UBI expects on the MTD device (per 1024 eraseblocks). If the underlying flash does not admit of bad eraseblocks (e.g. NOR flash), this value is ignored.  NAND datasheets often specify the minimum and maximum NVM (Number of Valid Blocks) for the flashes' endurance lifetime. The maximum expected bad eraseblocks per 1024 eraseblocks then can be calculated as 1024 * (1 - MinNVB / MaxNVB), which gives 20 for most NANDs (MaxNVB is basically the total count of eraseblocks on the chip).  To put it differently, if this value is 20, UBI will try to reserve about 1.9% of physical eraseblocks for bad blocks handling. And that will be 1.9% of eraseblocks on the entire NAND chip, not just the MTD partition UBI attaches. This means that if you have, say, a NAND flash chip admits maximum 40 bad eraseblocks, and it is split on two MTD partitions of the same size, UBI will reserve 40 eraseblocks when attaching a partition.  This option can be overridden by the mtd= UBI module parameter or by the attach ioctl.  Leave the default value if unsure.

DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT;Ordinarily all struct pages are initialised during early boot in a single thread. On very large machines this can take a considerable amount of time. If this option is set, large machines will bring up a subset of memmap at boot and then initialise the rest in parallel by starting one-off pgdatinitX kernel thread for each node X. This has a potential performance impact on processes running early in the lifetime of the system until these kthreads finish the initialisation.

In this case it is still possible to turn off redirects globally with the redirect_dir=off module option or on a filesystem instance basis with the redirect_dir=off mount option.  Note, that redirects are not backward compatible.  That is, mounting an overlay which has redirects on a kernel that doesn't support this feature will have unexpected results.
INFINIBAND_RDMAVT;This is a common software verbs provider for RDMA networks.

If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
PPP_BSDCOMP;Support for the BSD-Compress compression method for PPP, which uses the LZW compression method to compress each PPP packet before it is sent over the wire. The machine at the other end of the PPP link (usually your ISP) has to support the BSD-Compress compression method as well for this to be useful. Even if they don't support it, it is safe to say Y here.  The PPP Deflate compression method (PPP Deflate compression, above) is preferable to BSD-Compress, because it compresses better and is patent-free.  Note that the BSD compression code will always be compiled as a module. it is called bsd_comp and will show up in the directory modules once you have said make modules. If unsure, say N.

In automatic mode, it looks to the computer like a standard USB printer. Only printers may be connected to the USS-720 in this mode. The generic USB printer driver (USB Printer support, above) may be used in that mode, and you can say N here if you want to use the chip only in this mode.  Manual mode is not limited to printers, any parallel port device should work. This driver utilizes manual mode. Note however that some operations are three orders of magnitude slower than on a PCI/ISA Parallel Port, so timing critical applications might not work.  Say Y here if you own an USS-720 USB->Parport cable and intend to connect anything other than a printer to it.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called uss720.

PANEL_LCD_BWIDTH;Most LCDs use a standard controller which supports hardware lines of 40 characters, although sometimes only 16, 20 or 24 of them are really wired to the terminal. This results in some non-visible but addressable characters, and is the case for most parallel LCDs. Other LCDs, and some serial ones, however, use the same line width internally as what is visible. The KS0074 for example, uses 16 characters per line for 16 visible characters per line.  This option lets you configure the value used by your LCD in 'custom' profile. If you don't know, put '40' here.

The fifo_mode parameter is used to select endpoint allocation mode. fifo_mode = 0 is used to let the driver autoconfigure the endpoints. In this case, for ep1 2 banks are allocated if it works in isochronous mode and only 1 bank otherwise. For the rest of the endpoints only 1 bank is allocated.  fifo_mode = 1 is a generic maximum fifo size (1024 bytes) configuration allowing the usage of ep1 - ep6  fifo_mode = 2 is a generic performance maximum fifo size (1024 bytes) configuration allowing the usage of ep1 - ep3  fifo_mode = 3 is a balanced performance configuration allowing the the usage of ep1 - ep8

You can say Y or M here if you want to experiment with monitor detection code. You must say Y or M here if you want to use either second head of G400 or MGA-TVO on G200 or G400.  If you compile it as module, it will create a module named i2c-matroxfb.
UNUSED_SYMBOLS;Unused but exported symbols make the kernel needlessly bigger.  For that reason most of these unused exports will soon be removed.  This option is provided temporarily to provide a transition period in case some external kernel module needs one of these symbols anyway. If you encounter such a case in your module, consider if you are actually using the right API.  (rationale: since nobody in the kernel is using this in a module, there is a pretty good chance it's actually the wrong interface to use).  If you really need the symbol, please send a mail to the linux kernel mailing list mentioning the symbol and why you really need it, and what the merge plan to the mainline kernel for your module is.
BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE;The default value is 4096 kilobytes. Only change this if you know what you are doing.

If the boot loader provides a command line at boot time, it is appended to this string to form the full kernel command line, when the system boots.  However, you can use the CONFIG_CMDLINE_OVERRIDE option to change this behavior.  In most cases, the command line (whether built-in or provided by the boot loader) should specify the device for the root file system.
SND_MMP_SOC_BROWNSTONE;Say Y if you want to add support for SoC audio on the Marvell Brownstone reference platform.
KVM_GUEST;This option enables various optimizations for running under the KVM hypervisor. It includes a paravirtualized clock, so that instead of relying on a PIT (or probably other) emulation by the underlying device model, the host provides the guest with timing infrastructure such as time of day, and system time

SERIAL_MXS_AUART;This driver supports the MXS and Alphascale ASM9260 Application UART (AUART) port.
EISA_NAMES;By default, the kernel contains a database of all known EISA device names to make the information in sysfs comprehensible to the user. This database increases size of the kernel image by about 40KB, but it gets freed after the system boots up, so it doesn't take up kernel memory. Anyway, if you are building an installation floppy or kernel for an embedded system where kernel image size really matters, you can disable this feature and you'll get device ID instead of names.  When in doubt, say Y.
SND_ICE1724;Say Y here to include support for soundcards based on ICE/VT1724/1720 (Envy24HT/PT) chips.  Currently supported hardware is: AMP AUDIO2000. M-Audio Revolution 5.1, 7.1, Audiophile 192.

Applications include efficient power delivery and voltage regulation. In computer systems, PWMs are commonly used to control fans or the brightness of display backlights.  This framework provides a generic interface to PWM devices within the Linux kernel. On the driver side it provides an API to register and unregister a PWM chip, an abstraction of a PWM controller, that supports one or more PWM devices. Client drivers can request PWM devices and use the generic framework to configure as well as enable and disable them.  This generic framework replaces the legacy PWM framework which allows only a single driver implementing the required API. Not all legacy implementations have been ported to the framework yet. The framework provides an API that is backward compatible with the legacy framework so that existing client drivers continue to work as expected.  If unsure, say no.

When enabled with the default parameters, this option has almost no overhead, as it reserves a relatively small amount of memory and scans it infrequently.  It both detects corruption and prevents it from affecting the running system.  It is, however, intended as a diagnostic tool. if repeatable BIOS-originated corruption always affects the same memory, you can use memmap= to prevent the kernel from using that memory.

ACPI_REV_OVERRIDE_POSSIBLE;The platform firmware on some systems expects Linux to return 5 as the supported ACPI revision which makes it expose system configuration information in a special way.  For example, based on what ACPI exports as the supported revision, Dell XPS 13 (2015) configures its audio device to either work in HDA mode or in I2S mode, where the former is supposed to be used on Linux until the latter is fully supported (in the kernel as well as in user space).  This option enables a DMI-based quirk for the above Dell machine (so that HDA audio is exposed by the platform firmware to the kernel) and makes it possible to force the kernel to return 5 as the supported ACPI revision via the acpi_rev_override command line switch.
JOYSTICK_A3D;Say Y here if you have an FPGaming or MadCatz controller using the A3D protocol over the PC gameport.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called a3d.

LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION;Select this if the architecture wants to do dead code and data elimination with the linker by compiling with -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections and linking with --gc-sections.  This requires that the arch annotates or otherwise protects its external entry points from being discarded. Linker scripts must also merge .text.*, .data.*, and .bss.* correctly into output sections. Care must be taken not to pull in unrelated sections (e.g., '.text.init'). Typically '.' in section names is used to distinguish them from label names / C identifiers.
CAIF_TTY;The CAIF TTY transport driver is a Line Discipline (ldisc) identified as N_CAIF. When this ldisc is opened from user space it will redirect the TTY's traffic into the CAIF stack.

GART_IOMMU;Provides a driver for older AMD Athlon64/Opteron/Turion/Sempron GART based hardware IOMMUs.  The GART supports full DMA access for devices with 32-bit access limitations, on systems with more than 3 GB. This is usually needed for USB, sound, many IDE/SATA chipsets and some other devices.  Newer systems typically have a modern AMD IOMMU, supported via the CONFIG_AMD_IOMMU=y config option.  In normal configurations this driver is only active when needed: there's more than 3 GB of memory and the system contains a 32-bit limited device.  If unsure, say Y.

RENESAS_RZAWDT;This driver adds watchdog support for the integrated watchdogs in the Renesas RZ/A SoCs. These watchdogs can be used to reset a system.
DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE;kobjects are reference counted objects.  This means that their last reference count put is not predictable, and the kobject can live on past the point at which a driver decides to drop it's initial reference to the kobject gained on allocation.  An example of this would be a struct device which has just been unregistered.  However, some buggy drivers assume that after such an operation, the memory backing the kobject can be immediately freed.  This goes completely against the principles of a refcounted object.  If you say Y here, the kernel will delay the release of kobjects on the last reference count to improve the visibility of this kind of kobject release bug.
BT_SELFTEST_ECDH;Run test cases for ECDH cryptographic functionality used by the Bluetooth Low Energy Secure Connections feature.

This algorithm computes on multiple data lanes concurrently with SIMD instructions for better throughput.  It should not be enabled by default but used when there is significant amount of work to keep the keep the data lanes filled to get performance benefit.  If the data lanes remain unfilled, a flush operation will be initiated to process the crypto jobs, adding a slight latency.
CRYPTO_DEV_MEDIATEK;This driver allows you to utilize the hardware crypto accelerator EIP97 which can be found on the MT7623 MT2701, MT8521p, etc .... Select this if you want to use it for AES/SHA1/SHA2 algorithms.
NCPFS_SMALLDOS;If you say Y here, every filename on a NetWare server volume using the OS2/LONG namespace and created under DOS or on a volume using DOS namespace will be converted to lowercase characters. Saying N here will give you these filenames in uppercase.  This is only a cosmetic option since the OS2/LONG namespace is case insensitive. The only major reason for this option is backward compatibility when moving from DOS to OS2/LONG namespace support. Long filenames (created by Win95) will not be affected.  This option does not solve the problem that filenames appear differently under Linux and under Windows, since Windows does an additional conversions on the client side. You can achieve similar effects by saying Y to Allow using of Native Language Support below.

FB_XVR500;This is the framebuffer device for the Sun XVR-500 and similar graphics cards based upon the 3DLABS Wildcat chipset.  The driver only works on sparc64 systems where the system firmware has mostly initialized the card already.  It is treated as a completely dumb framebuffer device.
VIDEO_CX231XX;This is a video4linux driver for Conexant 231xx USB based TV cards.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called cx231xx
IMA_KEXEC;TPM PCRs are only reset on a hard reboot.  In order to validate a TPM's quote after a soft boot, the IMA measurement list of the running kernel must be saved and restored on boot.  Depending on the IMA policy, the measurement list can grow to be very large.
TOUCHSCREEN_WM831X;This enables support for the touchscreen controller on the WM831x series of PMICs.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called wm831x-ts.
ACPI_EXTLOG;Certain usages such as Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) require more information about the error than what can be described in processor machine check banks. Most server processors log additional information about the error in processor uncore registers. Since the addresses and layout of these registers vary widely from one processor to another, system software cannot readily make use of them. To complicate matters further, some of the additional error information cannot be constructed without detailed knowledge about platform topology.  Enhanced MCA Logging allows firmware to provide additional error information to system software, synchronous with MCE or CMCI. This driver adds support for that functionality with corresponding tracepoint which carries that information to userspace.
COMEDI_NI_USB6501;Enable support for the National Instruments USB-6501 module.  The NI USB-6501 is a Full-Speed USB 2.0 (12 Mbit/s) device that provides 24 digital I/O lines channels and one 32-bit counter.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ni_usb6501.

BLK_CGROUP;Generic block IO controller cgroup interface. This is the common cgroup interface which should be used by various IO controlling policies.  Currently, CFQ IO scheduler uses it to recognize task groups and control disk bandwidth allocation (proportional time slice allocation) to such task groups. It is also used by bio throttling logic in block layer to implement upper limit in IO rates on a device.  This option only enables generic Block IO controller infrastructure. One needs to also enable actual IO controlling logic/policy. For enabling proportional weight division of disk bandwidth in CFQ, set CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED=y. for enabling throttling policy, set CONFIG_BLK_DEV_THROTTLING=y.  See Documentation/cgroup-v1/blkio-controller.txt for more information.

CIFS_XATTR;Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes by the kernel or by users (see the attr(5) manual page, or visit <http://acl.bestbits.at/> for details).  CIFS maps the name of extended attributes beginning with the user namespace prefix to SMB/CIFS EAs. EAs are stored on Windows servers without the user namespace prefix, but their names are seen by Linux cifs clients prefaced by the user namespace prefix. The system namespace (used by some filesystems to store ACLs) is not supported at this time.  If unsure, say Y.
MDIO_BUS_MUX_GPIO;This module provides a driver for MDIO bus multiplexers that are controlled via GPIO lines.  The multiplexer connects one of several child MDIO busses to a parent bus.  Child bus selection is under the control of GPIO lines.
BSD_PROCESS_ACCT_V3;If you say Y here, the process accounting information is written in a new file format that also logs the process IDs of each process and it's parent. Note that this file format is incompatible with previous v0/v1/v2 file formats, so you will need updated tools for processing it. A preliminary version of these tools is available at <http://www.gnu.org/software/acct/>.
W1_SLAVE_DS2423;If you enable this you can read the counter values available in the DS2423 chipset from the w1_slave file under the sys file system.  Say Y here if you want to use a 1-wire counter family device (DS2423).

ARCNET_1051;This allows you to use RFC1051 with your ARCnet card via the virtual arc0s device. You only need arc0s if you want to talk to ARCnet software complying with the old standard, specifically, the DOS arcnet.com packet driver, Amigas running AmiTCP, and some variants of NetBSD. You do not need to say Y here to communicate with industry-standard RFC1201 implementations, like the arcether.com packet driver or most DOS/Windows ODI drivers. RFC1201 is included automatically as the arc0 device. Please read the ARCnet documentation in <file:Documentation/networking/arcnet.txt> for more information about using arc0e and arc0s.

EFIVAR_FS;efivarfs is a replacement filesystem for the old EFI variable support via sysfs, as it doesn't suffer from the same 1024-byte variable size limit.  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here. The module will be called efivarfs.  If unsure, say N.
DEBUG_LOCKING_API_SELFTESTS;Say Y here if you want the kernel to run a short self-test during bootup. The self-test checks whether common types of locking bugs are detected by debugging mechanisms or not. (if you disable lock debugging then those bugs wont be detected of course.) The following locking APIs are covered: spinlocks, rwlocks, mutexes and rwsems.

SERIAL_FSL_LPUART_CONSOLE;If you have enabled the lpuart serial port on the Freescale SoCs, you can make it the console by answering Y to this option.
PLIP;PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is used to create a reasonably fast mini network consisting of two (or, rarely, more) local machines.  A PLIP link from a Linux box is a popular means to install a Linux distribution on a machine which doesn't have a CD-ROM drive (a minimal system has to be transferred with floppies first). The kernels on both machines need to have this PLIP option enabled for this to work.  The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected with null printer or Turbo Laplink cables which can transmit 4 bits at a time (mode 0) or with special PLIP cables, to be used on bidirectional parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a time (mode 1). you can find the wiring of these cables in <file:Documentation/networking/PLIP.txt>.  The cables can be up to 15m long.  Mode 0 works also if one of the machines runs DOS/Windows and has some PLIP software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet driver (<http://oak.oakland.edu/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html>) and winsock or NCSA's telnet.  If you want to use PLIP, say Y and read the PLIP mini-HOWTO as well as the NET-3-HOWTO, both available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Note that the PLIP protocol has been changed and this PLIP driver won't work together with the PLIP support in Linux versions 1.0.x.  This option enlarges your kernel by about 8 KB.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will be called plip. If unsure, say Y or M, in case you buy a laptop later.
FMC_CHARDEV;This driver matches every mezzanine device and allows user space to read and write registers using a char device. It can be used to write user-space drivers, or just get acquainted with a mezzanine before writing its specific driver.
FB_S3C2410;Frame buffer driver for the built-in LCD controller in the Samsung S3C2410 processor.  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want). The module will be called s3c2410fb. If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say N.
SERIAL_FSL_LPUART;Support for the on-chip lpuart on some Freescale SOCs.
I2C_ROBOTFUZZ_OSIF;If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the RobotFuzz Open Source InterFace USB to I2C interface.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called i2c-osif.

CRYPTO_DES_SPARC64;DES cipher algorithm (FIPS 46-2), and Triple DES EDE (FIPS 46-3), optimized using SPARC64 crypto opcodes.
COMPACTION;Compaction is the only memory management component to form high order (larger physically contiguous) memory blocks reliably. The page allocator relies on compaction heavily and the lack of the feature can lead to unexpected OOM killer invocations for high order memory requests. You shouldn't disable this option unless there really is a strong reason for it and then we would be really interested to hear about that at linux-mm@kvack.org.
TABLET_USB_HANWANG;Say Y here if you want to use the USB version of the Hanwang Art Master III tablet.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called hanwang.
LOOPBACK_TARGET;Say Y here to enable the TCM Virtual SAS target and Linux/SCSI LLD fabric loopback module.
IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER;If you intend to run your Linux box mostly as a router, i.e. as a computer that forwards and redistributes network packets, say Y. you will then be presented with several options that allow more precise control about the routing process.  The answer to this question won't directly affect the kernel: answering N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about advanced routing.  Note that your box can only act as a router if you enable IP forwarding in your kernel. you can do that by saying Y to /proc file system support and Sysctl support below and executing the line  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.  If you turn on IP forwarding, you should consider the rp_filter, which automatically rejects incoming packets if the routing table entry for their source address doesn't match the network interface they're arriving on. This has security advantages because it prevents the so-called IP spoofing, however it can pose problems if you use asymmetric routing (packets from you to a host take a different path than packets from that host to you) or if you operate a non-routing host which has several IP addresses on different interfaces. To turn rp_filter on use:  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<device>/rp_filter  or echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter  Note that some distributions enable it in startup scripts. For details about rp_filter strict and loose mode read <file:Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt>.  If unsure, say N here.
MFD_LM3533;Say yes here to enable support for National Semiconductor / TI LM3533 Lighting Power chips.  This driver provides common support for accessing the device. additional drivers must be enabled in order to use the LED, backlight or ambient-light-sensor functionality of the device.
EXTCON_GPIO;Say Y here to enable GPIO based extcon support. Note that GPIO extcon supports single state per extcon instance.
IP_NF_SECURITY;This option adds a `security' table to iptables, for use with Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policy.  If unsure, say N.
RCU_FANOUT;This option controls the fanout of hierarchical implementations of RCU, allowing RCU to work efficiently on machines with large numbers of CPUs.  This value must be at least the fourth root of NR_CPUS, which allows NR_CPUS to be insanely large. The default value of RCU_FANOUT should be used for production systems, but if you are stress-testing the RCU implementation itself, small RCU_FANOUT values allow you to test large-system code paths on small(er) systems.  Select a specific number if testing RCU itself. Take the default if unsure.
ION_CHUNK_HEAP;Choose this option to enable chunk heaps with Ion. This heap is similar in function the carveout heap but memory is broken down into smaller chunk sizes, typically corresponding to a TLB size. Unless you know your system has these regions, you should say N here.

This will increase the throughput rate if the partitions reside on distinct disks.  Information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the Software-RAID mini-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. There you will also learn where to get the supporting user space utilities raidtools.  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called raid0.  If unsure, say Y.
MD_RAID1;A RAID-1 set consists of several disk drives which are exact copies of each other.  In the event of a mirror failure, the RAID driver will continue to use the operational mirrors in the set, providing an error free MD (multiple device) to the higher levels of the kernel.  In a set with N drives, the available space is the capacity of a single drive, and the set protects against a failure of (N - 1) drives.  Information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the Software-RAID mini-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  There you will also learn where to get the supporting user space utilities raidtools.  If you want to use such a RAID-1 set, say Y.  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called raid1.  If unsure, say Y.

SERIAL_8250_DEPRECATED_OPTIONS;In 3.7 we renamed 8250 to 8250_core by mistake, so now we have to accept kernel parameters in both forms like 8250_core.nr_uarts=4 and 8250.nr_uarts=4. We now renamed the module back to 8250, but if anybody noticed in 3.7 and changed their userspace we still have to keep the 8250_core.* options around until they revert the changes they already did.  If 8250 is built as a module, this adds 8250_core alias instead.   If you did not notice yet and/or you have userspace from pre-3.7, it is safe (and recommended) to say N here.

One of the nifty features of GFS is perfect consistency -- changes made to the filesystem on one machine show up immediately on all other machines in the cluster.  To use the GFS2 filesystem in a cluster, you will need to enable the locking module below. Documentation and utilities for GFS2 can be found here: http://sources.redhat.com/cluster  The nolock lock module is now built in to GFS2 by default.

BCH_CONST_PARAMS;Drivers may select this option to force specific constant values for parameters 'm' (Galois field order) and 't' (error correction capability). Those specific values must be set by declaring default values for symbols BCH_CONST_M and BCH_CONST_T. Doing so will enable extra compiler optimizations, improving encoding and decoding performance up to 2x for usual (m,t) values (typically such that m*t < 200). When this option is selected, the BCH library supports only a single (m,t) configuration. This is mainly useful for NAND flash board drivers requiring known, fixed BCH parameters.
CAIF;The Communication CPU to Application CPU Interface (CAIF) is a packet based connection-oriented MUX protocol developed by ST-Ericsson for use with its modems. It is accessed from user space as sockets (PF_CAIF).  Say Y (or M) here if you build for a phone product (e.g. Android or MeeGo ) that uses CAIF as transport, if unsure say N.  If you select to build it as module then CAIF_NETDEV also needs to be built as modules. You will also need to say yes to any CAIF physical devices that your platform requires.

SERIAL_PXA;If you have a machine based on an Intel XScale PXA2xx CPU you can enable its onboard serial ports by enabling this option.  Unless you have a specific need, you should use SERIAL_8250_PXA instead of this.
ACPI_REDUCED_HARDWARE_ONLY;This config item changes the way the ACPI code is built.  When this option is selected, the kernel will use a specialized version of ACPICA that ONLY supports the ACPI reduced hardware mode.  The resulting kernel will be smaller but it will also be restricted to running in ACPI reduced hardware mode ONLY.  If you are unsure what to do, do not enable this option.
DYNAMIC_DEBUG;Compiles debug level messages into the kernel, which would not otherwise be available at runtime. These messages can then be enabled/disabled based on various levels of scope - per source file, function, module, format string, and line number. This mechanism implicitly compiles in all pr_debug() and dev_dbg() calls, which enlarges the kernel text size by about 2%.  If a source file is compiled with DEBUG flag set, any pr_debug() calls in it are enabled by default, but can be disabled at runtime as below.  Note that DEBUG flag is turned on by many CONFIG_*DEBUG* options.  Usage:  Dynamic debugging is controlled via the 'dynamic_debug/control' file, which is contained in the 'debugfs' filesystem. Thus, the debugfs filesystem must first be mounted before making use of this feature. We refer the control file as: <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control. This file contains a list of the debug statements that can be enabled. The format for each line of the file is:        filename:lineno [module]function flags format  filename : source file of the debug statement lineno : line number of the debug statement module : module that contains the debug statement function : function that contains the debug statement flags : '=p' means the line is turned 'on' for printing format : the format used for the debug statement  From a live system:        nullarbor:~ # cat <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control       # filename:lineno [module]function flags format       fs/aio.c:222 [aio]__put_ioctx =_ __put_ioctx:\040freeing\040%p\012       fs/aio.c:248 [aio]ioctx_alloc =_ ENOMEM:\040nr_events\040too\040high\012       fs/aio.c:1770 [aio]sys_io_cancel =_ calling\040cancel\012  Example usage:        // enable the message at line 1603 of file svcsock.c       nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'file svcsock.c line 1603 +p' >                                       <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control        // enable all the messages in file svcsock.c       nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'file svcsock.c +p' >                                       <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control        // enable all the messages in the NFS server module       nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'module nfsd +p' >                                       <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control        // enable all 12 messages in the function svc_process()       nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'func svc_process +p' >                                       <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control        // disable all 12 messages in the function svc_process()       nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'func svc_process -p' >                                       <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control  See Documentation/admin-guide/dynamic-debug-howto.rst for additional information.

This means you cannot see any output sent to this frame buffer device, while it does consume precious memory. The main use of this frame buffer device is testing and debugging the frame buffer subsystem. Do NOT enable it for normal systems! To protect the innocent, it has to be enabled explicitly at boot time using the kernel option `video=vfb:'.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called vfb. In order to load it, you must use the vfb_enable=1 option.  If unsure, say N.

When set to 0, the driver will program the chip to only perform 32-bit DMA.  When set to 1, the chip will be able to perform DMA to addresses up to 1TB.  When set to 2, the driver supports the full 64-bit DMA address range, but can only address 16 segments of 4 GB each.  This limits the total addressable range to 64 GB.  Most machines with less than 4GB of memory should use a setting of 0 for best performance.  If your machine has 4GB of memory or more, you should set this option to 1 (the default).

The only way to be sure that this driver does what you want is to make sure you are running it on an EPX-C3 from Winsystems with the watchdog timer at IO address 0x1ee and 0x1ef.  It will write to both those IO ports.  Basically, the assumption is made that if you compile this driver into your kernel and/or load it as a module, that you know what you are doing and that you are in fact running on an EPX-C3 board!  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sbc_epx_c3.

MICROCHIP_KSZ_SPI_DRIVER;Select to enable support for registering switches configured through SPI.
COMEDI_NI_DAQ_700_CS;Enable support for the National Instruments PCMCIA DAQCard-700 DIO  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ni_daq_700.
USB_ETH_EEM;CDC EEM is a newer USB standard that is somewhat simpler than CDC ECM and therefore can be supported by more hardware.  Technically ECM and EEM are designed for different applications.  The ECM model extends the network interface to the target (e.g. a USB cable modem), and the EEM model is for mobile devices to communicate with hosts using ethernet over USB.  For Linux gadgets, however, the interface with the host is the same (a usbX device), so the differences are minimal.  If you say y here, the Ethernet gadget driver will use the EEM protocol rather than ECM.  If unsure, say n.

FB_IGA;This is the framebuffer device for the INTERGRAPHICS 1680 and successor frame buffer cards.
NFT_CHAIN_ROUTE_IPV6;This option enables the route chain for IPv6 in nf_tables. This chain type is used to force packet re-routing after mangling header fields such as the source, destination, flowlabel, hop-limit and the packet mark.
AMD_IOMMU;With this option you can enable support for AMD IOMMU hardware in your system. An IOMMU is a hardware component which provides remapping of DMA memory accesses from devices. With an AMD IOMMU you can isolate the DMA memory of different devices and protect the system from misbehaving device drivers or hardware.  You can find out if your system has an AMD IOMMU if you look into your BIOS for an option to enable it or if you have an IVRS ACPI table.
NFT_CHAIN_ROUTE_IPV4;This option enables the route chain for IPv4 in nf_tables. This chain type is used to force packet re-routing after mangling header fields such as the source, destination, type of service and the packet mark.

NET_DCCPPROBE;This module allows for capturing the changes to DCCP connection state in response to incoming packets. It is used for debugging DCCP congestion avoidance modules. If you don't understand what was just said, you don't need it: say N.  Documentation on how to use DCCP connection probing can be found at:    http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/dccpprobe  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called dccp_probe.
PAGE_POISONING;Fill the pages with poison patterns after free_pages() and verify the patterns before alloc_pages. The filling of the memory helps reduce the risk of information leaks from freed data. This does have a potential performance impact.  Note that poison here is not the same thing as the HWPoison for CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE. This is software poisoning only.  If unsure, say N
VME_PIO2;Say Y here to include support for the GE PIO2. The PIO2 is a 6U VME slave card, implementing 32 solid-state relay switched IO lines, in 4 groups of 8. Each bank of IO lines is built to function as input, output or both depending on the variant of the card.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will be called vme_pio2. If unsure, say N.
USB_CONFIGFS_F_PRINTER;The Printer function channels data between the USB host and a userspace program driving the print engine. The user space program reads and writes the device file /dev/g_printer<X> to receive or send printer data. It can use ioctl calls to the device file to get or set printer status.  For more information, see Documentation/usb/gadget_printer.txt which includes sample code for accessing the device file.
VIDEO_GO7007_USB;This is a video4linux driver for the WIS GO7007 MPEG encoder chip over USB.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called go7007-usb.
VIDEO_CX88_ENABLE_VP3054;This adds DVB-T support for cards based on the Conexant 2388x chip and the MT352 demodulator, which also require support for the VP-3054 Secondary I2C bus, such at DNTV Live! DVB-T Pro.
DVB_TTUSB_BUDGET;Support for external USB adapters designed by Technotrend and produced by Hauppauge, shipped under the brand name 'Nova-USB'.  These devices don't have a MPEG decoder built in, so you need an external software decoder to watch TV.  Say Y if you own such a device and want to use it.
PCI_XGENE;Say Y here if you want internal PCI support on APM X-Gene SoC. There are 5 internal PCIe ports available. Each port is GEN3 capable and have varied lanes from x1 to x8.

NET;Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here. The reason is that some programs need kernel networking support even when running on a stand-alone machine that isn't connected to any other computer.  If you are upgrading from an older kernel, you should consider updating your networking tools too because changes in the kernel and the tools often go hand in hand. The tools are contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number of which are given in <file:Documentation/Changes>.  For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.
IT8712F_WDT;This is the driver for the built-in watchdog timer on the IT8712F Super I/0 chipset used on many motherboards.

FB_XGI;This driver supports notebooks with XGI Z7,Z9,Z11 PCI chips. Say Y if you have such a graphics card. To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called xgifb.ko
SND_HDA_RECONFIG;Say Y here to enable the HD-audio codec re-configuration feature. It allows user to clear the whole codec configuration, change the codec setup, add extra verbs, and re-configure the codec dynamically.  Note that this item alone doesn't provide the sysfs interface, but enables the feature just for the patch loader below. If you need the traditional sysfs entries for the manual interaction, turn on CONFIG_SND_HDA_HWDEP as well.
NF_CONNTRACK_SNMP;SNMP service requests are sent as broadcast messages from an unprivileged port and responded to with unicast messages to the same port. This make them hard to firewall properly because connection tracking doesn't deal with broadcasts. This helper tracks locally originating SNMP service requests and the corresponding responses. It relies on correct IP address configuration, specifically netmask and broadcast address.  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
DEVFREQ_EVENT_EXYNOS_NOCP;This add the devfreq-event driver for Exynos SoC. It provides NoC (Network on Chip) Probe counters to measure the bandwidth of AXI bus.
CLKSRC_EXYNOS_MCT;Support for Multi Core Timer controller on Exynos SoCs.
FUNCTION_TRACER;Enable the kernel to trace every kernel function. This is done by using a compiler feature to insert a small, 5-byte No-Operation instruction at the beginning of every kernel function, which NOP sequence is then dynamically patched into a tracer call when tracing is enabled by the administrator. If it's runtime disabled (the bootup default), then the overhead of the instructions is very small and not measurable even in micro-benchmarks.
CAN_SJA1000_ISA;This driver adds legacy support for SJA1000 chips connected to the ISA bus using I/O port, memory mapped or indirect access.
WLAN_VENDOR_INTERSIL;If you have a wireless card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about  cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
TEST_LKM;This builds the test_module module that emits Hello, world on printk when loaded. It is designed to be used for basic evaluation of the module loading subsystem (for example when validating module verification). It lacks any extra dependencies, and will not normally be loaded by the system unless explicitly requested by name.  If unsure, say N.
MFD_DA9052_I2C;Support for the Dialog Semiconductor DA9052 PMIC when controlled using I2C. This driver provides common support for accessing the device, additional drivers must be enabled in order to use the functionality of the device.
IP6_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE;Masquerading is a special case of NAT: all outgoing connections are changed to seem to come from a particular interface's address, and if the interface goes down, those connections are lost.  This is only useful for dialup accounts with dynamic IP address (ie. your IP address will be different on next dialup).  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
SSB_DRIVER_MIPS;Driver for the Sonics Silicon Backplane attached Broadcom MIPS core.  If unsure, say N
EDAC_E7XXX;Support for error detection and correction on the Intel E7205, E7500, E7501 and E7505 server chipsets.

RTC_DRV_BFIN;If you say yes here you will get support for the Blackfin On-Chip Real Time Clock.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called rtc-bfin.
APM_DO_ENABLE;Enable APM features at boot time. From page 36 of the APM BIOS specification: When disabled, the APM BIOS does not automatically power manage devices, enter the Standby State, enter the Suspend State, or take power saving steps in response to CPU Idle calls. This driver will make CPU Idle calls when Linux is idle (unless this feature is turned off -- see Do CPU IDLE calls, below). This should always save battery power, but more complicated APM features will be dependent on your BIOS implementation. You may need to turn this option off if your computer hangs at boot time when using APM support, or if it beeps continuously instead of suspending. Turn this off if you have a NEC UltraLite Versa 33/C or a Toshiba T400CDT. This is off by default since most machines do fine without this feature.
DEBUG_MUTEXES;This feature allows mutex semantics violations to be detected and reported.
LEDS_BLINKM;This option enables support for the BlinkM RGB LED connected through I2C. Say Y to enable support for the BlinkM LED.
MV_XOR;Enable support for the Marvell XOR engine.
INPUT_88PM80X_ONKEY;Support the ONKEY of Marvell 88PM80x PMICs as an input device reporting power button status.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called 88pm80x_onkey.
GPIO_AXP209;Say yes to enable GPIO support for the AXP209 PMIC
EFI_PGT_DUMP;Enable this if you want to dump the EFI page table before enabling virtual mode. This can be used to debug miscellaneous issues with the mapping of the EFI runtime regions into that table.
MLX5_CORE_EN_DCB;Say Y here if you want to use Data Center Bridging (DCB) in the driver. If set to N, will not be able to configure QoS and ratelimit attributes. This flag is depended on the kernel's DCB support.  If unsure, set to Y
CONTEXT_TRACKING_FORCE;The major pre-requirement for full dynticks to work is to support the context tracking subsystem. But there are also other dependencies to provide in order to make the full dynticks working.  This option stands for testing when an arch implements the context tracking backend but doesn't yet fullfill all the requirements to make the full dynticks feature working. Without the full dynticks, there is no way to test the support for context tracking and the subsystems that rely on it: RCU userspace extended quiescent state and tickless cputime accounting. This option copes with the absence of the full dynticks subsystem by forcing the context tracking on all CPUs in the system.  Say Y only if you're working on the development of an architecture backend for the context tracking.  Say N otherwise, this option brings an overhead that you don't want in production.
RTC_DRV_BRCMSTB;If you say yes here you get support for the wake-timer found on Broadcom STB SoCs (BCM7xxx).  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called rtc-brcmstb-waketimer.

This includes HUB6 support, shared serial interrupts, special multiport support, support for more than the four COM 1/2/3/4 boards, etc.  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about serial driver options. If unsure, say N.
QCOM_Q6V5_PIL;Say y here to support the Qualcomm Peripherial Image Loader for the Hexagon V5 based remote processors.
CFG80211;cfg80211 is the Linux wireless LAN (802.11) configuration API. Enable this if you have a wireless device.  For more information refer to documentation on the wireless wiki:  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/Documentation/cfg80211  When built as a module it will be called cfg80211.
PCIE_ARMADA_8K;Say Y here if you want to enable PCIe controller support on Armada-8K SoCs. The PCIe controller on Armada-8K is based on Designware hardware and therefore the driver re-uses the Designware core functions to implement the driver.
SND_MAESTRO3_INPUT;If you say Y here, you will get an input device which reports keypresses for the volume buttons connected to the maestro3 chip. If you say N the buttons will directly control the master volume. It is recommended to say Y.
LBDAF;Enable block devices or files of size 2TB and larger.  This option is required to support the full capacity of large (2TB+) block devices, including RAID, disk, Network Block Device, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) and loopback.  This option also enables support for single files larger than 2TB.  The ext4 filesystem requires that this feature be enabled in order to support filesystems that have the huge_file feature enabled.  Otherwise, it will refuse to mount in the read-write mode any filesystems that use the huge_file feature, which is enabled by default by mke2fs.ext4.  The GFS2 filesystem also requires this feature.  If unsure, say Y.

This module supports RAS, Fast Start, H.245 Tunnelling, Call Forwarding, RTP/RTCP and T.120 based audio, video, fax, chat, whiteboard, file transfer, etc. For more information, please visit http://nath323.sourceforge.net/.  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
FAT_FS;If you want to use one of the FAT-based file systems (the MS-DOS and VFAT (Windows 95) file systems), then you must say Y or M here to include FAT support. You will then be able to mount partitions or diskettes with FAT-based file systems and transparently access the files on them, i.e. MSDOS files will look and behave just like all other Unix files.  This FAT support is not a file system in itself, it only provides the foundation for the other file systems. You will have to say Y or M to at least one of MSDOS fs support or VFAT fs support in order to make use of it.  Another way to read and write MSDOS floppies and hard drive partitions from within Linux (but not transparently) is with the mtools (man mtools) program suite. You don't need to say Y here in order to do that.  If you need to move large files on floppies between a DOS and a Linux box, say Y here, mount the floppy under Linux with an MSDOS file system and use GNU tar's M option. GNU tar is a program available for Unix and DOS (man tar or info tar).  The FAT support will enlarge your kernel by about 37 KB. If unsure, say Y.  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called fat.  Note that if you compile the FAT support as a module, you cannot compile any of the FAT-based file systems into the kernel -- they will have to be modules as well.
DRM_I2C_SIL164;Support for sil164 and similar single-link (or dual-link when used in pairs) TMDS transmitters, used in some nVidia video cards.
LIBNVDIMM;Generic support for non-volatile memory devices including ACPI-6-NFIT defined resources.  On platforms that define an NFIT, or otherwise can discover NVDIMM resources, a libnvdimm bus is registered to advertise PMEM (persistent memory) namespaces (/dev/pmemX) and BLK (sliding mmio window(s)) namespaces (/dev/ndblkX.Y). A PMEM namespace refers to a memory resource that may span multiple DIMMs and support DAX (see CONFIG_DAX).  A BLK namespace refers to an NVDIMM control region which exposes an mmio register set for windowed access mode to non-volatile memory.

IP_DCCP_CCID3;CCID-3 denotes TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), an equation-based rate-controlled congestion control mechanism.  TFRC is designed to be reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP-like flows, where a flow is reasonably fair if its sending rate is generally within a factor of two of the sending rate of a TCP flow under the same conditions.  However, TFRC has a much lower variation of throughput over time compared with TCP, which makes CCID-3 more suitable than CCID-2 for applications such streaming media where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance.  CCID-3 is further described in RFC 4342, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4342.txt  The TFRC congestion control algorithms were initially described in RFC 5348.  This text was extracted from RFC 4340 (sec. 10.2), http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4340.txt  If in doubt, say N.

BFIN_UART0_CTSRTS;Enable hardware flow control in the driver.
PM_DEVFREQ;A device may have a list of frequencies and voltages available. devfreq, a generic DVFS framework can be registered for a device in order to let the governor provided to devfreq choose an operating frequency based on the device driver's policy.  Each device may have its own governor and policy. Devfreq can reevaluate the device state periodically and/or based on the notification to nb, a notifier block, of devfreq.  Like some CPUs with CPUfreq, a device may have multiple clocks. However, because the clock frequencies of a single device are determined by the single device's state, an instance of devfreq is attached to a single device and returns a representative clock frequency of the device, which is also attached to a device by 1-to-1. The device registering devfreq takes the responsibility to interpret the representative frequency and to set its every clock accordingly with the target callback given to devfreq.  When OPP is used with the devfreq device, it is recommended to register devfreq's nb to the OPP's notifier head.  If OPP is used with the devfreq device, you may use OPP helper functions defined in devfreq.h.

BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD;Normally, IDE controllers built into the motherboard (on-board controllers) are assigned to ide0 and ide1 while those on add-in PCI cards (off-board controllers) are relegated to ide2 and ide3. Answering Y here will allow you to reverse the situation, with off-board controllers on ide0/1 and on-board controllers on ide2/3. This can improve the usability of some boot managers such as lilo when booting from a drive on an off-board controller.  Note that, if you do this, the order of the hd* devices will be rearranged which may require modification of fstab and other files.  Please also note that this method of assuring stable naming of IDE devices is unreliable and use other means for achieving it (i.e. udev).  If in doubt, say N.

By default, this is disabled at runtime and can be selectively enabled at runtime for different parts of the code using the sysfs debug-levels file.  If set at zero, this will compile out all the debug code.  It is recommended that it is left at 8.
ATM_LANAI;Supports ATM cards based on the Efficient Networks Lanai chipset such as the Speedstream 3010 and the ENI-25p.  The Speedstream 3060 is currently not supported since we don't have the code to drive the on-board Alcatel DSL chipset (yet).
X86_32_NON_STANDARD;This option compiles in the bigsmp and STA2X11 default subarchitectures.  It is intended for a generic binary kernel. If you select them all, kernel will probe it one by one and will fallback to default.

Before the switch to the netlink-based uevent source, this was used to hook hotplug scripts into kernel device events. It usually pointed to a shell script at /sbin/hotplug. This should not be used today, because usual systems create many events at bootup or device discovery in a very short time frame. One forked process per event can create so many processes that it creates a high system load, or on smaller systems it is known to create out-of-memory situations during bootup.

To provide an additional layer of security, route all of these calls through a single executable that can not have its name changed.  Note, it is up to this single binary to then call the relevant real usermode helper binary, based on the first argument passed to it.  If desired, this program can filter and pick and choose what real programs are called.  If you wish for all usermode helper programs are to be disabled, choose this option and then set STATIC_USERMODEHELPER_PATH to an empty string.

POWER_SUPPLY_DEBUG;Say Y here to enable debugging messages for power supply class and drivers.
TEST_KMOD;Test the kernel's module loading mechanism: kmod. kmod implements support to load modules using the Linux kernel's usermode helper. This test provides a series of tests against kmod.  Although technically you can either build test_kmod as a module or into the kernel we disallow building it into the kernel since it stress tests request_module() and this will very likely cause some issues by taking over precious threads available from other module load requests, ultimately this could be fatal.  To run tests run:  tools/testing/selftests/kmod/kmod.sh --help  If unsure, say N.

SCSI;If you want to use a SCSI hard disk, SCSI tape drive, SCSI CD-ROM or any other SCSI device under Linux, say Y and make sure that you know the name of your SCSI host adapter (the card inside your computer that speaks the SCSI protocol, also called SCSI controller), because you will be asked for it.  You also need to say Y here if you have a device which speaks the SCSI protocol.  Examples of this include the parallel port version of the IOMEGA ZIP drive, USB storage devices, Fibre Channel, and FireWire storage.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read <file:Documentation/scsi/scsi.txt>. The module will be called scsi_mod.  However, do not compile this as a module if your root file system (the one containing the directory /) is located on a SCSI device.

For the ALi-chipset question, ALi suggests you refer to <http://www.ali.com.tw/>.  The M1541 chipset can do AGP 1x and 2x, but note that there is an acknowledged incompatibility with Matrox G200 cards. Due to timing issues, this chipset cannot do AGP 2x with the G200. This is a hardware limitation. AGP 1x seems to be fine, though.
X86_PTDUMP;Say Y here if you want to show the kernel pagetable layout in a debugfs file. This information is only useful for kernel developers who are working in architecture specific areas of the kernel. It is probably not a good idea to enable this feature in a production kernel. If in doubt, say N
COMPILE_TEST;Some drivers can be compiled on a different platform than they are intended to be run on. Despite they cannot be loaded there (or even when they load they cannot be used due to missing HW support), developers still, opposing to distributors, might want to build such drivers to compile-test them.  If you are a developer and want to build everything available, say Y here. If you are a user/distributor, say N here to exclude useless drivers to be distributed.

This driver also works with the digitizer (VSXXX-AB) DEC produced.
SERIAL_ZS_CONSOLE;If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the system console (the system console is the device which receives all kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode).  Note that the firmware uses ttyS1 as the serial console on the Maxine and ttyS3 on the others using this driver.  If unsure, say Y.
SENSORS_FTSTEUTATES;If you say yes here you get support for the Fujitsu Technology Solutions (FTS) sensor chip Teutates including support for the integrated watchdog.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called ftsteutates.

HAVE_SYSCALL_TRACEPOINTS;See Documentation/trace/ftrace-design.txt
COMPAT_BRK;Randomizing heap placement makes heap exploits harder, but it also breaks ancient binaries (including anything libc5 based). This option changes the bootup default to heap randomization disabled, and can be overridden at runtime by setting /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space to 2.  On non-ancient distros (post-2000 ones) N is usually a safe choice.
PCMCIA;This option enables support for 16-bit PCMCIA cards. Most older PC-cards are such 16-bit PCMCIA cards, so unless you know you're only using 32-bit CardBus cards, say Y or M here.  To use 16-bit PCMCIA cards, you will need supporting software in most cases. (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and details).

SSB_DRIVER_GPIO;Driver to provide access to the GPIO pins on the bus.  If unsure, say N
CACHEFILES_HISTOGRAM;This option causes latency information to be gathered on CacheFiles operation and exported through file:        /proc/fs/cachefiles/histogram  The generation of this histogram adds a certain amount of overhead to execution as there are a number of points at which data is gathered, and on a multi-CPU system these may be on cachelines that keep bouncing between CPUs.  On the other hand, the histogram may be useful for debugging purposes.  Saying 'N' here is recommended.  See Documentation/filesystems/caching/cachefiles.txt for more information.
PCIE_PTM;This enables PCI Express Precision Time Measurement (PTM) support.  This is only useful if you have devices that support PTM, but it is safe to enable even if you don't.

MAC80211_TDLS_DEBUG;Selecting this option causes mac80211 to print out very verbose TDLS selection debugging messages (when mac80211 is a TDLS STA). It should not be selected on production systems as those messages are remotely triggerable.  Do not select this option.
USB_NET_SMSC75XX;This option adds support for SMSC LAN75XX based USB 2.0 Gigabit Ethernet adapters.
IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT;The REJECT target allows a filtering rule to specify that an ICMP error should be issued in response to an incoming packet, rather than silently being dropped.  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
FB_OMAP_MANUAL_UPDATE;Say Y here, if your user-space applications are capable of notifying the frame buffer driver when a change has occurred in the frame buffer content and thus a reload of the image data to the external frame buffer is required. If unsure, say N.
RTC_DRV_RK808;If you say yes here you will get support for the RTC of RK808 and RK818 PMIC.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called rk808-rtc.

To compile this driver as a module, chose M here: the module will be called xen-netfront.
GCC_PLUGIN_LATENT_ENTROPY;By saying Y here the kernel will instrument some kernel code to extract some entropy from both original and artificially created program state.  This will help especially embedded systems where there is little 'natural' source of entropy normally.  The cost is some slowdown of the boot process (about 0.5%) and fork and irq processing.  Note that entropy extracted this way is not cryptographically secure!  This plugin was ported from grsecurity/PaX. More information at:  * https://grsecurity.net/  * https://pax.grsecurity.net/
TRACEPOINT_BENCHMARK;This option creates the tracepoint benchmark:benchmark_event. When the tracepoint is enabled, it kicks off a kernel thread that goes into an infinite loop (calling cond_sched() to let other tasks run), and calls the tracepoint. Each iteration will record the time it took to write to the tracepoint and the next iteration that data will be passed to the tracepoint itself. That is, the tracepoint will report the time it took to do the previous tracepoint. The string written to the tracepoint is a static string of 128 bytes to keep the time the same. The initial string is simply a write of START. The second string records the cold cache time of the first write which is not added to the rest of the calculations.  As it is a tight loop, it benchmarks as hot cache. That's fine because we care most about hot paths that are probably in cache already.  An example of the output:       START      first=3672 [COLD CACHED]      last=632 first=3672 max=632 min=632 avg=316 std=446 std^2=199712      last=278 first=3672 max=632 min=278 avg=303 std=316 std^2=100337      last=277 first=3672 max=632 min=277 avg=296 std=258 std^2=67064      last=273 first=3672 max=632 min=273 avg=292 std=224 std^2=50411      last=273 first=3672 max=632 min=273 avg=288 std=200 std^2=40389      last=281 first=3672 max=632 min=273 avg=287 std=183 std^2=33666

BFIN_OTP;If you say Y here, you will get support for a character device interface into the One Time Programmable memory pages that are stored on the Blackfin processor.  This will not get you access to the secure memory pages however.  You will need to write your own secure code and reader for that.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called bfin-otp.  If unsure, it is safe to say Y.
SOC_CAMERA_MT9M111;This driver supports MT9M111, MT9M112 and MT9M131 cameras from Micron/Aptina. This is the legacy configuration which shouldn't be used anymore, while VIDEO_MT9M111 should be used instead.

Hardlockups are bugs that cause the CPU to loop in kernel mode for more than 10 seconds, without letting other interrupts have a chance to run.  The current stack trace is displayed upon detection and the system will stay locked up.
NFT_REJECT;This option adds the reject expression that you can use to explicitly deny and notify via TCP reset/ICMP informational errors unallowed traffic.
NLS_MAC_ICELAND;The Apple HFS file system family can deal with filenames in native language character sets. These character sets are stored in so-called MAC codepages. You need to include the appropriate codepage if you want to be able to read/write these filenames on Mac partitions correctly. This does apply to the filenames only, not to the file contents. You can include several codepages. say Y here if you want to include the Mac codepage that is used for Iceland.  If unsure, say Y.

LEDS_CLASS_FLASH;This option enables the flash led sysfs class in /sys/class/leds. It wrapps LED Class and adds flash LEDs specific sysfs attributes and kernel internal API to it. You'll need this to provide support for the flash related features of a LED device. It can be built as a module.
GPIO_ALTERA;Say Y or M here to build support for the Altera PIO device.  If driver is built as a module it will be called gpio-altera.
PROC_CHILDREN;Provides a fast way to retrieve first level children pids of a task. See <file:Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt> for more information.  Say Y if you are running any user-space software which takes benefit from this interface. For example, rkt is such a piece of software.
USB_NET_RNDIS_HOST;This option enables hosting Remote NDIS USB networking links, as encouraged by Microsoft (instead of CDC Ethernet!) for use in various devices that may only support this protocol.  A variant of this protocol (with even less public documentation) seems to be at the root of Microsoft's ActiveSync too.  Avoid using this protocol unless you have no better options. The protocol specification is incomplete, and is controlled by (and for) Microsoft. it isn't an Open ecosystem or market.

The 8250 serial port driver also uses these numbers, which means the two drivers being unable to coexist. you could not use both z85C30 and 8250 type ports at the same time.  If this option is not selected, the pmac_zilog driver will use the device numbers allocated for /dev/ttyPZn.  This allows the pmac_zilog and 8250 drivers to co-exist, but may cause existing userspace setups to break.  Programs that need to access the built-in serial ports on powermacs will need to be reconfigured to use /dev/ttyPZn instead of /dev/ttySn.  If you enable this option, any z85c30 ports in the system will be registered as ttyS0 onwards as in the past, and you will be unable to use the 8250 module for PCMCIA or other 16C550-style UARTs.

CMDLINE_BOOL;Allow for specifying boot arguments to the kernel at build time.  On some systems (e.g. embedded ones), it is necessary or convenient to provide some or all of the kernel boot arguments with the kernel itself (that is, to not rely on the boot loader to provide them.)  To compile command line arguments into the kernel, set this option to 'Y', then fill in the boot arguments in CONFIG_CMDLINE.  Systems with fully functional boot loaders (i.e. non-embedded) should leave this option set to 'N'.
SND_DRIVERS;Support for generic sound devices.
MMC35240;Say yes here to build support for the MEMSIC MMC35240 3-axis magnetic sensor.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called mmc35240.
TUN;TUN/TAP provides packet reception and transmission for user space programs.  It can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or Ethernet device, which instead of receiving packets from a physical media, receives them from user space program and instead of sending packets via physical media writes them to the user space program.  When a program opens /dev/net/tun, driver creates and registers corresponding net device tunX or tapX.  After a program closed above devices, driver will automatically delete tunXX or tapXX device and all routes corresponding to it.  Please read <file:Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt> for more information.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called tun.  If you don't know what to use this for, you don't need it.
BRIDGE;If you say Y here, then your Linux box will be able to act as an Ethernet bridge, which means that the different Ethernet segments it is connected to will appear as one Ethernet to the participants. Several such bridges can work together to create even larger networks of Ethernets using the IEEE 802.1 spanning tree algorithm. As this is a standard, Linux bridges will cooperate properly with other third party bridge products.  In order to use the Ethernet bridge, you'll need the bridge configuration tools. see <file:Documentation/networking/bridge.txt> for location. Please read the Bridge mini-HOWTO for more information.  If you enable iptables support along with the bridge support then you turn your bridge into a bridging IP firewall. iptables will then see the IP packets being bridged, so you need to take this into account when setting up your firewall rules. Enabling arptables support when bridging will let arptables see bridged ARP traffic in the arptables FORWARD chain.  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called bridge.  If unsure, say N.
ATMEL_SDRAMC;This driver is for Atmel SDRAM Controller or Atmel Multi-port DDR-SDRAM Controller available on Atmel AT91SAM9 and SAMA5 SoCs. Starting with the at91sam9g45, this controller supports SDR, DDR and LP-DDR memories.

SERIAL_KGDB_NMI;This special driver allows you to temporary use NMI debugger port as a normal console (assuming that the port is attached to KGDB).  Unlike KDB's disable_nmi command, with this driver you are always able to go back to the debugger using KGDB escape sequence ($3#33). This is because this console driver processes the input in NMI context, and thus is able to intercept the magic sequence.  Note that since the console interprets input and uses polling communication methods, for things like PPP you still must fully detach debugger port from the KGDB NMI (i.e. disable_nmi), and use raw console.  If unsure, say N.
HID_MICROSOFT;Support for Microsoft devices that are not fully compliant with HID standard.
RTC_DS1685_SYSFS_REGS;Enable this to provide access to the RTC control register bits in /sys.  Some of the bits are read-write, others are read-only.

For more information, see <file:Documentation/filesystems/inotify.txt>  If unsure, say Y.
SLUB_STATS;SLUB statistics are useful to debug SLUBs allocation behavior in order find ways to optimize the allocator. This should never be enabled for production use since keeping statistics slows down the allocator by a few percentage points. The slabinfo command supports the determination of the most active slabs to figure out which slabs are relevant to a particular load. Try running: slabinfo -DA
HW_RANDOM_OMAP3_ROM;This driver provides kernel-side support for the Random Number Generator hardware found on OMAP34xx processors.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called omap3-rom-rng.  If unsure, say Y.

Saying Y here allows you to read these partition tables and further mount Solaris x86 partitions from within Linux if you have also said Y to UFS file system support, above.
NET_VENDOR_TUNDRA;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about Tundra cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
USB_OXU210HP_HCD;The OXU210HP is an USB host/OTG/device controller. Enable this option if your board has this chip. If unsure, say N.

This implementation is partially kernel-based to reduce overhead in the already-mounted case. this is unlike the BSD automounter (amd), which is a pure user space daemon.  To use the automounter you need the user-space tools from <https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/autofs/v4/>. you also want to answer Y to NFS file system support, below.  To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the module will be called autofs4.  You will need to add alias autofs autofs4 to your modules configuration file.  If you are not a part of a fairly large, distributed network or don't have a laptop which needs to dynamically reconfigure to the local network, you probably do not need an automounter, and can say N here.

MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED;Normally, and according to the Linux spec, anonymous memory obtained from mmap() has it's contents cleared before it is passed to userspace.  Enabling this config option allows you to request that mmap() skip that if it is given an MAP_UNINITIALIZED flag, thus providing a huge performance boost.  If this option is not enabled, then the flag will be ignored.  This is taken advantage of by uClibc's malloc(), and also by ELF-FDPIC binfmt's brk and stack allocator.  Because of the obvious security issues, this option should only be enabled on embedded devices where you control what is run in userspace.  Since that isn't generally a problem on no-MMU systems, it is normally safe to say Y here.  See Documentation/nommu-mmap.txt for more information.

To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
S3C2410_WATCHDOG;Watchdog timer block in the Samsung SoCs. This will reboot the system when the timer expires with the watchdog enabled.  The driver is limited by the speed of the system's PCLK signal, so with reasonably fast systems (PCLK around 50-66MHz) then watchdog intervals of over approximately 20seconds are unavailable.  The driver can be built as a module by choosing M, and will be called s3c2410_wdt

WARN_ALL_UNSEEDED_RANDOM;Some parts of the kernel contain bugs relating to their use of cryptographically secure random numbers before it's actually possible to generate those numbers securely. This setting ensures that these flaws don't go unnoticed, by enabling a message, should this ever occur. This will allow people with obscure setups to know when things are going wrong, so that they might contact developers about fixing it.  Unfortunately, on some models of some architectures getting a fully seeded CRNG is extremely difficult, and so this can result in dmesg getting spammed for a surprisingly long time.  This is really bad from a security perspective, and so architecture maintainers really need to do what they can to get the CRNG seeded sooner after the system is booted. However, since users can not do anything actionble to address this, by default the kernel will issue only a single warning for the first use of unseeded randomness.  Say Y here if you want to receive warnings for all uses of unseeded randomness.  This will be of use primarily for those developers interersted in improving the security of Linux kernels running on their architecture (or subarchitecture).

ISCSI_BOOT_SYSFS;This option enables support for exposing iSCSI boot information via sysfs to userspace. If you wish to export this information, say Y. Otherwise, say N.
SND_SOC_TTC_DKB;Say Y if you want to add support for SoC audio on TTC DKB
MANDATORY_FILE_LOCKING;This option enables files appropriately marked files on appropriely mounted filesystems to support mandatory locking.  To the best of my knowledge this is dead code that no one cares about.
RCU_EQS_DEBUG;This option provides consistency checks in RCU's handling of NO_HZ.  These checks have proven quite helpful in detecting bugs in arch-specific NO_HZ code.  Say N here if you need ultimate kernel/user switch latencies Say Y if you are unsure
SCSI_ACORNSCSI_SYNC;Say Y here to enable synchronous transfer negotiation with all targets on the Acorn SCSI card.  In general, this improves performance. however some SCSI devices don't implement it properly, so the safe answer is N.

TINYDRM_MI0283QT;DRM driver for the Multi-Inno MI0283QT display panel If M is selected the module will be called mi0283qt.
NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_DEVGROUP;This options adds a `devgroup' match, which allows to match on the device group a network device is assigned to.  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
GPIO_ADNP;This option enables support for N GPIOs found on Avionic Design I2C GPIO expanders. The register space will be extended by powers of two, so the controller will need to accommodate for that. For example: if a controller provides 48 pins, 6 registers will be enough to represent all pins, but the driver will assume a register layout for 64 pins (8 registers).
MIGRATION;Allows the migration of the physical location of pages of processes while the virtual addresses are not changed. This is useful in two situations. The first is on NUMA systems to put pages nearer to the processors accessing. The second is when allocating huge pages as migration can relocate pages to satisfy a huge page allocation instead of reclaiming.
GREYBUS_CAMERA;Select this option if you have a device that follows the Greybus Camera Class specification.  To compile this code as a module, chose M here: the module will be called gb-camera.ko
SCSI_DH_EMC;If you have a EMC CLARiiON select y. Otherwise, say N.

NET_9P_DEBUG;Say Y if you want the 9P subsystem to log debug information.
MEMTEST;This option adds a kernel parameter 'memtest', which allows memtest to be set.       memtest=0, mean disabled. -- default       memtest=1, mean do 1 test pattern.       ...       memtest=17, mean do 17 test patterns. If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.
PWM_STMPE;This enables support for the PWMs found in the STMPE I/O expanders.
CLKSRC_JCORE_PIT;This enables build of clocksource and clockevent driver for the integrated PIT in the J-Core synthesizable, open source SoC.
BLK_DEV_UMEM;Saying Y here will include support for the MM5415 family of battery backed (Non-volatile) RAM cards. <http://www.umem.com/>  The cards appear as block devices that can be partitioned into as many as 15 partitions.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called umem.  The umem driver has not yet been allocated a MAJOR number, so one is chosen dynamically.
INPUT_ADXL34X_SPI;Say Y here if you have ADXL345/6 hooked to a SPI bus.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called adxl34x-spi.
SMS_SIANO_DEBUGFS;Choose Y to enable visualizing a dump of the frontend statistics response packets via debugfs. Currently, works only with Siano USB devices.  Useful only for developers. In doubt, say N.
SERIAL_SUNSU_CONSOLE;If you would like to be able to use the SU serial port on your Sparc system as the console, you can do so by answering Y to this option.
VM_EVENT_COUNTERS;VM event counters are needed for event counts to be shown. This option allows the disabling of the VM event counters on EXPERT systems.  /proc/vmstat will only show page counts if VM event counters are disabled.
COMMON_CLK_HI655X;This driver supports the hi655x PMIC clock. This multi-function device has one fixed-rate oscillator, clocked at 32KHz.
RTL8821AE;This is the driver for Realtek RTL8821AE/RTL8812AE 802.11ac PCIe wireless network adapters.  If you choose to build it as a module, it will be called rtl8821ae
RPMSG_QCOM_SMD;Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver providing communication channels to remote processors in Qualcomm platforms.
NWBUTTON_REBOOT;If you say Y here, then you will be able to initiate a system shutdown and reboot by pressing the orange button a number of times. The number of presses to initiate the shutdown is two by default, but this can be altered by modifying the value of NUM_PRESSES_REBOOT in nwbutton.h and recompiling the driver or, if you compile the driver as a module, you can specify the number of presses at load time with insmod button reboot_count=<something>.
SCx200_ACB;Enable the use of the ACCESS.bus controllers on the Geode SCx200 and SC1100 processors and the CS5535 and CS5536 Geode companion devices.  If you don't know what to do here, say N.  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module will be called scx200_acb.
VIDEO_BT819;Support for BT819A video decoder.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called bt819.
PD6729;This provides support for the Cirrus PD6729 PCI-to-PCMCIA bridge device, found in some older laptops and PCMCIA card readers.
INET_XFRM_MODE_TUNNEL;Support for IPsec tunnel mode.  If unsure, say Y.
SENSORS_AD7414;If you say yes here you get support for the Analog Devices AD7414 temperature monitoring chip.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called ad7414.

MFD_MT6397;Say yes here to add support for MediaTek MT6397 PMIC. This is a Power Management IC. This driver provides common support for accessing the device. additional drivers must be enabled in order to use the functionality of the device.
SPI_OMAP24XX;SPI master controller for OMAP24XX and later Multichannel SPI (McSPI) modules.
SND_AT73C213;Say Y here if you want to use the Atmel AT73C213 external DAC. This DAC can be found on Atmel development boards.  This driver requires the Atmel SSC driver for sound sink, a peripheral found on most AT91 and AVR32 microprocessors.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called snd-at73c213.
JOYSTICK_MAGELLAN;Say Y here if you have a Magellan or Space Mouse 6DOF controller connected to your computer's serial port.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called magellan.
UNISYS_VISORINPUT;The Unisys s-Par visorinput driver provides a virtualized system console (keyboard and mouse) that is accessible through the s-Par firmware's user interface. s-Par provides video using the EFI GOP protocol, so If this driver is not present, the Linux guest should still boot with visible output in the partition desktop, but keyboard and mouse interaction will not be available.
NEW_LEDS;Say Y to enable Linux LED support.  This allows control of supported LEDs from both userspace and optionally, by kernel events (triggers).
COMPAT_VDSO;Certain buggy versions of glibc will crash if they are presented with a 32-bit vDSO that is not mapped at the address indicated in its segment table.  The bug was introduced by f866314b89d56845f55e6f365e18b31ec978ec3a and fixed by 3b3ddb4f7db98ec9e912ccdf54d35df4aa30e04a and 49ad572a70b8aeb91e57483a11dd1b77e31c4468.  Glibc 2.3.3 is the only released version with the bug, but OpenSUSE 9 contains a buggy glibc 2.3.2.  The symptom of the bug is that everything crashes on startup, saying: dl_main: Assertion `(void *) ph->p_vaddr == _rtld_local._dl_sysinfo_dso' failed!  Saying Y here changes the default value of the vdso32 boot option from 1 to 0, which turns off the 32-bit vDSO entirely. This works around the glibc bug but hurts performance.  If unsure, say N: if you are compiling your own kernel, you are unlikely to be using a buggy version of glibc.
RTC_DRV_WM8350;If you say yes here you will get support for the RTC subsystem of the Wolfson Microelectronics WM8350.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called rtc-wm8350.
SND_EDMA_SOC;Say Y or M here if you want audio support for TI SoC which uses eDMA. The following line of SoCs are supported by this platform driver: - daVinci devices - AM335x - AM437x/AM438x - DRA7xx family
KXSD9;Say yes here to build support for the Kionix KXSD9 accelerometer. It can be accessed using an (optional) SPI or I2C interface.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called kxsd9.

VEXPRESS_CONFIG;Platform configuration infrastructure for the ARM Ltd. Versatile Express.
CPA_DEBUG;Do change_page_attr() self-tests every 30 seconds.
SQUASHFS_XZ;Saying Y here includes support for reading Squashfs file systems compressed with XZ compression.  XZ gives better compression than the default zlib compression, at the expense of greater CPU and memory overhead.  XZ is not the standard compression used in Squashfs and so most file systems will be readable without selecting this option.  If unsure, say N.
NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_CLUSTER;This option allows you to build work-load-sharing clusters of network servers/stateful firewalls without having a dedicated load-balancing router/server/switch. Basically, this match returns true when the packet must be handled by this cluster node. Thus, all nodes see all packets and this match decides which node handles what packets. The work-load sharing algorithm is based on source address hashing.  If you say Y or M here, try `iptables -m cluster --help` for more information.
GPIO_OMAP;Say yes here to enable GPIO support for TI OMAP SoCs.
SERIAL_SCCNXP_CONSOLE;Support for console on SCCNXP serial ports.
VIDEO_CX231XX_DVB;This adds support for DVB cards based on the Conexant cx231xx chips.
USB_STORAGE_KARMA;Say Y here to include additional code to support the Rio Karma USB interface.  This code places the Rio Karma into mass storage mode, enabling it to be mounted as an ordinary filesystem. Performing an eject on the resulting scsi device node returns the Karma to normal operation.  If this driver is compiled as a module, it will be named ums-karma.
QUEUED_LOCK_STAT;Enable the collection of statistical data on the slowpath behavior of paravirtualized queued spinlocks and report them on debugfs.
XEN;This is the Linux Xen port.  Enabling this will allow the kernel to boot in a paravirtualized environment under the Xen hypervisor.
MSND_FIFOSIZE;Configures the size of each audio buffer, in kilobytes, for recording and playing in the MultiSound drivers (both the Classic and Pinnacle). Larger values reduce the chance of data overruns at the expense of overall latency. If unsure, use the default.
BLK_DEV_ALI15X3;This driver ensures (U)DMA support for ALI 1533, 1543 and 1543C onboard chipsets.  It also tests for Simplex mode and enables normal dual channel support.  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/alim15x3.c>.  If unsure, say N.
MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL;Modules which contain a MODULE_VERSION get an extra srcversion field inserted into their modinfo section, which contains a sum of the source files which made it.  This helps maintainers see exactly which source was used to build a module (since others sometimes change the module source without updating the version).  With this option, such a srcversion field will be created for all modules.  If unsure, say N.
CRYPTO_DEV_FSL_CAAM_INTC_COUNT_THLD;Select number of descriptor completions to queue before raising an interrupt, in the range 1-255. Note that a selection of 1 functionally defeats the coalescing feature, and a selection equal or greater than the job ring size will force timeouts.
M586TSC;Select this for a Pentium Classic processor with the RDTSC (Read Time Stamp Counter) instruction for benchmarking.
DVB_S5H1409;An ATSC 8VSB and QAM64/256 tuner module. Say Y when you want to support this frontend.
HID_SENSOR_IIO_TRIGGER;Say yes here to build trigger support for HID sensors. Triggers will be send if all requested attributes were read.  If this driver is compiled as a module, it will be named hid-sensor-trigger.
IOSF_MBI_DEBUG;Select this option to expose the IOSF sideband access registers (MCR, MDR, MCRX) through debugfs to write and read register information from different units on the SoC. This is most useful for obtaining device state information for debug and analysis. As this is a general access mechanism, users of this option would have specific knowledge of the device they want to access.  If you don't require the option or are in doubt, say N.
IIO_TRIGGER;Provides IIO core support for triggers.  Currently these are used to initialize capture of samples to push into buffers.  The triggers are effectively a 'capture data now' interrupt.
CMA_DEBUG;Turns on debug messages in CMA.  This produces KERN_DEBUG messages for every CMA call as well as various messages while processing calls such as dma_alloc_from_contiguous(). This option does not affect warning and error messages.
VIDEO_DAVINCI_VPIF_CAPTURE;Enables Davinci VPIF module used for capture devices. This module is used for capture on TI DM6467/DA850/OMAPL138 SoCs.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. There will be two modules called vpif.ko and vpif_capture.ko
KMX61;Say Y here if you want to build a driver for Kionix KMX61 6-axis accelerometer and magnetometer. To compile this driver as module, choose M here: the module will be called kmx61.
FB_OMAP_DMA_TUNE;On systems in which video memory is in system memory (SDRAM) this will speed up graphics DMA operations. If you have such a system and want to use rotation answer yes. Answer no if you have a dedicated video memory, or don't use any of the accelerated features.
ENCRYPTED_KEYS;This option provides support for create/encrypting/decrypting keys in the kernel.  Encrypted keys are kernel generated random numbers, which are encrypted/decrypted with a 'master' symmetric key. The 'master' key can be either a trusted-key or user-key type. Userspace only ever sees/stores encrypted blobs.  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.
INTEL_SOC_DTS_IOSF_CORE;This is becoming a common feature for Intel SoCs to expose the additional digital temperature sensors (DTSs) using side band interface (IOSF). This implements the common set of helper functions to register, get temperature and get/set thresholds on DTSs.
MLX_CPLD_PLATFORM;This driver handles hot-plug events for the power suppliers, power cables and fans on the wide range Mellanox IB and Ethernet systems.
CRYPTO_DEV_NX_COMPRESS;Support for PowerPC Nest (NX) compression acceleration. This module supports acceleration for compressing memory with the 842 algorithm using the cryptographic API.  One of the platform drivers must be selected also.  If you choose 'M' here, this module will be called nx_compress.
BLK_DEV_DRBD;NOTE: In order to authenticate connections you have to select CRYPTO_HMAC and a hash function as well.  DRBD is a shared-nothing, synchronously replicated block device. It is designed to serve as a building block for high availability clusters and in this context, is a drop-in replacement for shared storage. Simplistically, you could see it as a network RAID 1.  Each minor device has a role, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'. On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to the local 'lower level block device' and, across the network, to the node with the device in 'secondary' state.  The secondary device simply writes the data to its lower level block device.  DRBD can also be used in dual-Primary mode (device writable on both nodes), which means it can exhibit shared disk semantics in a shared-nothing cluster.  Needless to say, on top of dual-Primary DRBD utilizing a cluster file system is necessary to maintain for cache coherency.  For automatic failover you need a cluster manager (e.g. heartbeat). See also: http://www.drbd.org/, http://www.linux-ha.org  If unsure, say N.
TOUCHSCREEN_MTOUCH;Say Y here if you have a MicroTouch (3M) serial touchscreen connected to your system.  If unsure, say N.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called mtouch.
BLK_DEV_BSGLIB;Subsystems will normally enable this if needed. Users will not normally need to manually enable this.  If unsure, say N.
MTD_SPI_NOR_USE_4K_SECTORS;Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB). Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using 64 KiB block instead of 16 × 4 KiB sectors.  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with 4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).
STATIC_KEYS_SELFTEST;Boot time self-test of the branch patching code.
MMC_SDHCI_PCI;This selects the PCI Secure Digital Host Controller Interface. Most controllers found today are PCI devices.  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.  If unsure, say N.
INET_XFRM_MODE_TRANSPORT;Support for IPsec transport mode.  If unsure, say Y.
EXT4_DEBUG;Enables run-time debugging support for the ext4 filesystem.  If you select Y here, then you will be able to turn on debugging with a command such as:       echo 1 > /sys/module/ext4/parameters/mballoc_debug
GPIO_TWL4030;Say yes here to access the GPIO signals of various multi-function power management chips from Texas Instruments.
PRINTK_SAFE_LOG_BUF_SHIFT;Select the size of an alternate printk per-CPU buffer where messages printed from usafe contexts are temporary stored. One example would be NMI messages, another one - printk recursion. The messages are copied to the main log buffer in a safe context to avoid a deadlock. The value defines the size as a power of 2.  Those messages are rare and limited. The largest one is when a backtrace is printed. It usually fits into 4KB. Select 8KB if you want to be on the safe side.  Examples:            17 => 128 KB for each CPU            16 =>  64 KB for each CPU            15 =>  32 KB for each CPU            14 =>  16 KB for each CPU            13 =>   8 KB for each CPU            12 =>   4 KB for each CPU
FB_TFT_HX8353D;Generic Framebuffer support for HX8353D
IP_MULTICAST;This is code for addressing several networked computers at once, enlarging your kernel by about 2 KB. You need multicasting if you intend to participate in the MBONE, a high bandwidth network on top of the Internet which carries audio and video broadcasts. More information about the MBONE is on the WWW at <http://www.savetz.com/mbone/>. For most people, it's safe to say N.
NET_VENDOR_ALTEON;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about Alteon cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
IR_TTUSBIR;Say Y here if you want to use the TechnoTrend USB IR Receiver. The driver can control the led.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ttusbir.
BT_BNEP_MC_FILTER;This option enables the multicast filter support for BNEP.
DM_DEBUG;Enable this for messages that may help debug device-mapper problems.  If unsure, say N.
NFT_BRIDGE_META;Add support for bridge dedicated meta key.
ARCNET_RIM_I;This is yet another chipset driver for the COM90xx cards, but this time only using memory-mapped mode, and no IO ports at all. This driver is completely untested, so if you have one of these cards, please mail <dwmw2@infradead.org>, especially if it works!  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will be called arc-rimi.
NFS_FS;Choose Y here if you want to access files residing on other computers using Sun's Network File System protocol.  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the module will be called nfs.  To mount file systems exported by NFS servers, you also need to install the user space mount.nfs command which can be found in the Linux nfs-utils package, available from http://linux-nfs.org/. Information about using the mount command is available in the mount(8) man page.  More detail about the Linux NFS client implementation is available via the nfs(5) man page.  Below you can choose which versions of the NFS protocol are available in the kernel to mount NFS servers.  Support for NFS version 2 (RFC 1094) is always available when NFS_FS is selected.  To configure a system which mounts its root file system via NFS at boot time, say Y here, select Kernel level IP autoconfiguration in the NETWORK menu, and select Root file system on NFS below.  You cannot compile this file system as a module in this case.  If unsure, say N.
MT7621_WDT;Hardware driver for the Mediatek/Ralink MT7621/8 SoC Watchdog Timer.
CAIF_DEBUG;Enable the inclusion of debug code in the CAIF stack. Be aware that doing this will impact performance. If unsure say N.
N_GSM;This line discipline provides support for the GSM MUX protocol and presents the mux as a set of 61 individual tty devices.
USB_MDC800;Say Y here if you want to connect this type of still camera to your computer's USB port. This driver can be used with gphoto 0.4.3 and higher (look at <http://www.gphoto.org/>). To use it create a device node with mknod /dev/mustek c 180 32 and configure it in your software.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called mdc800.
HYPERV_NET;Select this option to enable the Hyper-V virtual network driver.
MEDIA_TUNER_FC2580;FCI FC2580 silicon tuner driver.
HIGH_RES_TIMERS;This option enables high resolution timer support. If your hardware is not capable then this option only increases the size of the kernel image.
COMEDI_CONTEC_PCI_DIO;Enable support for the Contec PIO1616L digital I/O board  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called contec_pci_dio.
FB_PROVIDE_GET_FB_UNMAPPED_AREA;Allow generic frame-buffer to provide get_fb_unmapped_area function.
USB_SERIAL_UPD78F0730;Say Y here if you want to use the Renesas uPD78F0730 serial driver.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called upd78f0730.
SND_PCM_OSS;To enable OSS digital audio (PCM) emulation (/dev/dsp*), say Y here and read <file:Documentation/sound/alsa/OSS-Emulation.txt>.  Many programs still use the OSS API, so say Y.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called snd-pcm-oss.
BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC;Say Y here to enable the kernel to panic on hung tasks, which are bugs that cause the kernel to leave a task stuck in uninterruptible D state.  The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout, to cause the system to reboot automatically after a hung task has been detected. This feature is useful for high-availability systems that have uptime guarantees and where a hung tasks must be resolved ASAP.  Say N if unsure.
CIFS_UPCALL;Enables an upcall mechanism for CIFS which accesses userspace helper utilities to provide SPNEGO packaged (RFC 4178) Kerberos tickets which are needed to mount to certain secure servers (for which more secure Kerberos authentication is required). If unsure, say Y.
ZPA2326;Say Y here to build support for the Murata ZPA2326 pressure and temperature sensor.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called zpa2326.
W90P910_ETH;Say Y here if you want to use built-in Ethernet ports on w90p910 processor.
DASD_ECKD;ECKD devices are the most commonly used devices. You should enable this option unless you are very sure to have no ECKD device.
M686;Select this for Intel Pentium Pro chips.  This enables the use of Pentium Pro extended instructions, and disables the init-time guard against the f00f bug found in earlier Pentiums.
DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED;If you say Y here gcc is instructed to generate less debugging information for structure types. This means that tools that need full debugging information (like kgdb or systemtap) won't be happy. But if you merely need debugging information to resolve line numbers there is no loss. Advantage is that build directory object sizes shrink dramatically over a full DEBUG_INFO build and compile times are reduced too. Only works with newer gcc versions.
IP_VS_NQ;The never queue scheduling algorithm adopts a two-speed model. When there is an idle server available, the job will be sent to the idle server, instead of waiting for a fast one. When there is no idle server available, the job will be sent to the server that minimize its expected delay (The Shortest Expected Delay scheduling algorithm).  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. To compile it as a module, choose M here. If unsure, say N.
SATA_DWC;This option enables support for the on-chip SATA controller of the AppliedMicro processor 460EX.  If unsure, say N.
PPPOL2TP;Support for PPP-over-L2TP socket family. L2TP is a protocol used by ISPs and enterprises to tunnel PPP traffic over UDP tunnels. L2TP is replacing PPTP for VPN uses.
PATA_OPTIDMA;This option enables DMA/PIO support for the later OPTi controllers found on some old motherboards and in some laptops.  If unsure, say N.
DM_MULTIPATH;Allow volume managers to support multipath hardware.
PRINTER;If you intend to attach a printer to the parallel port of your Linux box (as opposed to using a serial printer. if the connector at the printer has 9 or 25 holes [female], then it's serial), say Y. Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices (e.g. printer and ZIP drive) and it is safe to compile the corresponding drivers into the kernel.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  The module will be called lp.  If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to use with the lp kernel command line option.  (Try man bootparam or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the lp command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.  If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO macro in lp.c and the PARPORT_MAX macro in parport.h.
KALLSYMS_BASE_RELATIVE;Instead of emitting them as absolute values in the native word size, emit the symbol references in the kallsyms table as 32-bit entries, each containing a relative value in the range [base, base + U32_MAX] or, when KALLSYMS_ABSOLUTE_PERCPU is in effect, each containing either an absolute value in the range [0, S32_MAX] or a relative value in the range [base, base + S32_MAX], where base is the lowest relative symbol address encountered in the image.  On 64-bit builds, this reduces the size of the address table by 50%, but more importantly, it results in entries whose values are build time constants, and no relocation pass is required at runtime to fix up the entries based on the runtime load address of the kernel.
KXSD9_I2C;Say yes here to enable the Kionix KXSD9 accelerometer I2C transport channel.
RAPIDIO_ENUM_BASIC;This option includes basic RapidIO fabric enumeration and discovery mechanism similar to one described in RapidIO specification Annex 1.
PATA_PDC2027X;This option enables support for Promise PATA pdc20268 to pdc20277 host adapters.  If unsure, say N.

USELIB;This option enables the uselib syscall, a system call used in the dynamic linker from libc5 and earlier.  glibc does not use this system call.  If you intend to run programs built on libc5 or earlier, you may need to enable this syscall.  Current systems running glibc can safely disable this.
AF_KCM;KCM (Kernel Connection Multiplexor) sockets provide a method for multiplexing messages of a message based application protocol over kernel connectons (e.g. TCP connections).
NET_FOU;Foo over UDP allows any IP protocol to be directly encapsulated over UDP include tunnels (IPIP, GRE, SIT). By encapsulating in UDP network mechanisms and optimizations for UDP (such as ECMP and RSS) can be leveraged to provide better service.

This algorithm classifies the waiting packets into a tree-like hierarchy of classes. the leaves of this tree are in turn scheduled by separate algorithms.  See the top of <file:net/sched/sch_cbq.c> for more details.  CBQ is a commonly used scheduler, so if you're unsure, you should say Y here. Then say Y to all the queueing algorithms below that you want to use as leaf disciplines.  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sch_cbq.
I2C_PARPORT_LIGHT;This supports parallel port I2C adapters such as the ones made by Philips or Velleman, Analog Devices evaluation boards, and more. Basically any adapter using the parallel port as an I2C bus with no extra chipset is supported by this driver, or could be.  This driver is a light version of i2c-parport.  It doesn't depend on the parport driver, and uses direct I/O access instead.  This might be preferred on embedded systems where wasting memory for the clean but heavy parport handling is not an option.  The drawback is a reduced portability and the impossibility to daisy-chain other parallel port devices.  Don't say Y here if you said Y or M to i2c-parport.  Saying M to both is possible but both modules should not be loaded at the same time.  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module will be called i2c-parport-light.

Platform firmware or a device driver may identify a platform memory resource that is differentiated from the baseline memory pool.  Mappings of a /dev/daxX.Y device impose restrictions that make the mapping behavior deterministic.
MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADDRESS;By default, the probe for DiskOnChip devices will look for a DiskOnChip at every multiple of 0x2000 between 0xC8000 and 0xEE000. This option allows you to specify a single address at which to probe for the device, which is useful if you have other devices in that range which get upset when they are probed.  (Note that on PowerPC, the normal probe will only check at 0xE4000000.)  Normally, you should leave this set to zero, to allow the probe at the normal addresses.

X86_SYSFB;Firmwares often provide initial graphics framebuffers so the BIOS, bootloader or kernel can show basic video-output during boot for user-guidance and debugging. Historically, x86 used the VESA BIOS Extensions and EFI-framebuffers for this, which are mostly limited to x86. This option, if enabled, marks VGA/VBE/EFI framebuffers as generic framebuffers so the new generic system-framebuffer drivers can be used on x86. If the framebuffer is not compatible with the generic modes, it is adverticed as fallback platform framebuffer so legacy drivers like efifb, vesafb and uvesafb can pick it up. If this option is not selected, all system framebuffers are always marked as fallback platform framebuffers as usual.  Note: Legacy fbdev drivers, including vesafb, efifb, uvesafb, will not be able to pick up generic system framebuffers if this option is selected. You are highly encouraged to enable simplefb as replacement if you select this option. simplefb can correctly deal with generic system framebuffers. But you should still keep vesafb and others enabled as fallback if a system framebuffer is incompatible with simplefb.  If unsure, say Y.
VXLAN;This allows one to create vxlan virtual interfaces that provide Layer 2 Networks over Layer 3 Networks. VXLAN is often used to tunnel virtual network infrastructure in virtualized environments. For more information see:   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan-02  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called vxlan.

OWL_TIMER;Enables the support for the Actions Semi Owl timer driver.
X86_LEGACY_VM86;This option allows user programs to put the CPU into V8086 mode, which is an 80286-era approximation of 16-bit real mode.  Some very old versions of X and/or vbetool require this option for user mode setting.  Similarly, DOSEMU will use it if available to accelerate real mode DOS programs.  However, any recent version of DOSEMU, X, or vbetool should be fully functional even without kernel VM86 support, as they will all fall back to software emulation. Nevertheless, if you are using a 16-bit DOS program where 16-bit performance matters, vm86 mode might be faster than emulation and you might want to enable this option.  Note that any app that works on a 64-bit kernel is unlikely to need this option, as 64-bit kernels don't, and can't, support V8086 mode. This option is also unrelated to 16-bit protected mode and is not needed to run most 16-bit programs under Wine.  Enabling this option increases the complexity of the kernel and slows down exception handling a tiny bit.  If unsure, say N here.
SND_AZT2316;Say Y here to include support for Aztech Sound Galaxy cards based on the AZT2316 chipset.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called snd-azt2316.

In order to use this driver, you will need a microcode (uCode) image for it. You can obtain the microcode from:          <http://intellinuxwireless.org/>.  The microcode is typically installed in /lib/firmware. You can look in the hotplug script /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent to determine which directory FIRMWARE_DIR is set to when the script runs.  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.  The module will be called iwl4965.

SCHED_MC_PRIO;Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 enabled CPUs have a core ordering determined at manufacturing time, which allows certain cores to reach higher turbo frequencies (when running single threaded workloads) than others.  Enabling this kernel feature teaches the scheduler about the TBM3 (aka ITMT) priority order of the CPU cores and adjusts the scheduler's CPU selection logic accordingly, so that higher overall system performance can be achieved.  This feature will have no effect on CPUs without this feature.  If unsure say Y here.
NFC_NXP_NCI;Generic core driver for NXP NCI chips such as the NPC100 or PN7150 families. This is a driver based on the NCI NFC kernel layers and will thus not work with NXP libnfc library.  To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will be called nxp_nci. Say N if unsure.

Anyone wishing to use HP Smart Array controllers who would prefer the devices be presented to linux as SCSI devices, rather than as generic block devices should say Y here.
ATM_HORIZON_DEBUG;Somewhat useful debugging messages are available. The choice of messages is controlled by a bitmap.  This may be specified as a module argument (kernel command line argument as well?), changed dynamically using an ioctl (not yet) or changed by sending the string Dxxxx to VCI 1023 (where x is a hex digit).  See the file <file:drivers/atm/horizon.h> for the meanings of the bits in the mask.  When active, these messages can have a significant impact on the speed of the driver, and the size of your syslog files! When inactive, they will have only a modest impact on performance.

All Ethernet frames sent over the hsr device will be sent in both directions on the ring (over both slave ports), giving a redundant, instant fail-over network. Each HSR node in the ring acts like a bridge for HSR frames, but filters frames that have been forwarded earlier.  This code is a best effort to comply with the HSR standard as described in IEC 62439-3:2010 (HSRv0) and IEC 62439-3:2012 (HSRv1), but no compliancy tests have been made.

PROVIDE_OHCI1394_DMA_INIT;If you want to debug problems which hang or crash the kernel early on boot and the crashing machine has a FireWire port, you can use this feature to remotely access the memory of the crashed machine over FireWire. This employs remote DMA as part of the OHCI1394 specification which is now the standard for FireWire controllers.  With remote DMA, you can monitor the printk buffer remotely using firescope and access all memory below 4GB using fireproxy from gdb. Even controlling a kernel debugger is possible using remote DMA.  Usage:  If ohci1394_dma=early is used as boot parameter, it will initialize all OHCI1394 controllers which are found in the PCI config space.  As all changes to the FireWire bus such as enabling and disabling devices cause a bus reset and thereby disable remote DMA for all devices, be sure to have the cable plugged and FireWire enabled on the debugging host before booting the debug target for debugging.  This code (~1k) is freed after boot. By then, the firewire stack in charge of the OHCI-1394 controllers should be used instead.  See Documentation/debugging-via-ohci1394.txt for more information.

NO_HZ_FULL_ALL;If the user doesn't pass the nohz_full boot option to define the range of full dynticks CPUs, consider that all CPUs in the system are full dynticks by default. Note the boot CPU will still be kept outside the range to handle the timekeeping duty.
ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE;An architecture should select this when it can successfully build and run with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE.
MTD_DC21285;This provides a driver for the flash accessed using Intel's 21285 bridge used with Intel's StrongARM processors. More info at <http://www.intel.com/design/bridge/docs/21285_documentation.htm>.

SCSI_MPT3SAS;This driver supports PCI-Express SAS 12Gb/s Host Adapters.
INET;These are the protocols used on the Internet and on most local Ethernets. It is highly recommended to say Y here (this will enlarge your kernel by about 400 KB), since some programs (e.g. the X window system) use TCP/IP even if your machine is not connected to any other computer. You will get the so-called loopback device which allows you to ping yourself (great fun, that!).  For an excellent introduction to Linux networking, please read the Linux Networking HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  If you say Y here and also to /proc file system support and Sysctl support below, you can change various aspects of the behavior of the TCP/IP code by writing to the (virtual) files in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/*. the options are explained in the file <file:Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt>.

FB_S3C_DEBUG_REGWRITE;Show all register writes via pr_debug()
INTEL_IMR;This option provides a means to manipulate Isolated Memory Regions. IMRs are a set of registers that define read and write access masks to prohibit certain system agents from accessing memory with 1 KiB granularity.  IMRs make it possible to control read/write access to an address by hardware agents inside the SoC. Read and write masks can be defined for:       - eSRAM flush       - Dirty CPU snoop (write only)       - RMU access       - PCI Virtual Channel 0/Virtual Channel 1       - SMM mode       - Non SMM mode  Quark contains a set of eight IMR registers and makes use of those registers during its bootup process.  If you are running on a Galileo/Quark say Y here.

VIDEO_MXB;This is a video4linux driver for the 'Multimedia eXtension Board' TV card by Siemens-Nixdorf.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called mxb.
TMPFS;Tmpfs is a file system which keeps all files in virtual memory.  Everything in tmpfs is temporary in the sense that no files will be created on your hard drive. The files live in memory and swap space. If you unmount a tmpfs instance, everything stored therein is lost.  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt> for details.
SPI_AU1550;If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the PSC SPI controller found on Au1550, Au1200 and Au1300 series.

CRYPTO_SHA1_PPC;This is the powerpc hardware accelerated implementation of the SHA-1 secure hash standard (FIPS 180-1/DFIPS 180-2).
CORE_DUMP_DEFAULT_ELF_HEADERS;ELF core dump files describe each memory mapping of the crashed process, and can contain or omit the memory contents of each one. The contents of an unmodified text mapping are omitted by default.  For an unmodified text mapping of an ELF object, including just the first page of the file in a core dump makes it possible to identify the build ID bits in the file, without paying the i/o cost and disk space to dump all the text.  However, versions of GDB before 6.7 are confused by ELF core dump files in this format.  The core dump behavior can be controlled per process using the /proc/PID/coredump_filter pseudo-file. this setting is inherited.  See Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt for details.  This config option changes the default setting of coredump_filter seen at boot time.  If unsure, say Y.

HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS;Some architectures are unable to perform unaligned accesses without the use of get_unaligned/put_unaligned. Others are unable to perform such accesses efficiently (e.g. trap on unaligned access and require fixing it up in the exception handler.)  This symbol should be selected by an architecture if it can perform unaligned accesses efficiently to allow different code paths to be selected for these cases. Some network drivers, for example, could opt to not fix up alignment problems with received packets if doing so would not help much.  See Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt for more information on the topic of unaligned memory accesses.
FSL_QMAN_TEST_STASH;This performs a hot potato style test enqueuing/dequeuing a frame across a series of FQs scheduled to different portals (and cpus), with DQRR, data and context stashing always on.

If a user enables this functionality under Windows and then reboots into Linux, the system may remain configured to resume on suspend. In the absence of any userspace to support it, the system will then remain awake until something triggers another suspend.  This driver checks to determine whether the device has Intel Smart Connect enabled, and if so disables it.
HISAX_ELSA;This enables HiSax support for the Elsa Mircolink ISA cards, for the Elsa Quickstep series cards and Elsa PCMCIA.  See <file:Documentation/isdn/README.HiSax> on how to configure it using the different cards, a different D-channel protocol, or non-standard IRQ/port settings.
EXT4_FS;This is the next generation of the ext3 filesystem.  Unlike the change from ext2 filesystem to ext3 filesystem, the on-disk format of ext4 is not forwards compatible with ext3. it is based on extent maps and it supports 48-bit physical block numbers.  The ext4 filesystem also supports delayed allocation, persistent preallocation, high resolution time stamps, and a number of other features to improve performance and speed up fsck time.  For more information, please see the web pages at http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org.  The ext4 filesystem supports mounting an ext3 filesystem. while there are some performance gains from the delayed allocation and inode table readahead, the best performance gains require enabling ext4 features in the filesystem using tune2fs, or formatting a new filesystem as an ext4 filesystem initially. Without explicit enabling of ext4 features, the on disk filesystem format stays fully backward compatible.  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here. The module will be called ext4.  If unsure, say N.
AB8500_CORE;Select this option to enable access to AB8500 power management chip. This connects to U8500 either on the SSP/SPI bus (deprecated since hardware version v1.0) or the I2C bus via PRCMU. It also adds the irq_chip parts for handling the Mixed Signal chip events. This chip embeds various other multimedia funtionalities as well.

LEDS_ASIC3;This option enables support for the LEDs on the HTC ASIC3. The HTC ASIC3 LED GPIOs are inputs, not outputs, thus the leds-gpio driver cannot be used. This driver supports hardware blinking with an on+off period from 62ms to 125s. Say Y to enable LEDs on the HP iPAQ hx4700.
RTC_HCTOSYS;If you say yes here, the system time (wall clock) will be set using the value read from a specified RTC device. This is useful to avoid unnecessary fsck runs at boot time, and to network better.
CXL_BIMODAL;Select this option to enable support for bi-modal CAPI cards, such as the Mellanox CX-4.
NET_VENDOR_XIRCOM;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about Xircom cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
USB_SERIAL_IPW;Say Y here if you want to use a IPWireless USB modem such as the ones supplied by Axity3G/Sentech South Africa.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ipw.

DEBUG_PAGE_REF;This is a feature to add tracepoint for tracking down page reference manipulation. This tracking is useful to diagnose functional failure due to migration failures caused by page reference mismatches.  Be careful when enabling this feature because it adds about 30 KB to the kernel code.  However the runtime performance overhead is virtually nil until the tracepoints are actually enabled.
USB_FOTG210_HCD;Faraday FOTG210 is an OTG controller which can be configured as an USB2.0 host. It is designed to meet USB2.0 EHCI specification with minor modification.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called fotg210-hcd.

SND_POWERMAC_AUTO_DRC;Say Y here to enable the automatic toggle of DRC (dynamic range compression) on Tumbler/Snapper. If this feature is enabled, DRC is turned off when the headphone/line jack is plugged, and turned on when unplugged.  Note that you can turn on/off DRC manually even without this option.
HIGHMEM4G;Select this if you have a 32-bit processor and between 1 and 4 gigabytes of physical RAM.
SLUB_MEMCG_SYSFS_ON;SLUB creates a directory under /sys/kernel/slab for each allocation cache to host info and debug files. If memory cgroup is enabled, each cache can have per memory cgroup caches. SLUB can create the same sysfs directories for these caches under /sys/kernel/slab/CACHE/cgroup but it can lead to a very high number of debug files being created. This is controlled by slub_memcg_sysfs boot parameter and this config option determines the parameter's default value.
NET_EMATCH_CMP;Say Y here if you want to be able to classify packets based on simple packet data comparisons for 8, 16, and 32bit values.  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called em_cmp.

The ADC channel is read via IIO framework and the channel information is provided to this driver. This driver reports the temperature by reading ADC channel and converts it to temperature based on lookup table.
WDTPCI;If you have a PCI-WDT500/501 watchdog board, say Y here, otherwise N.  If you have a PCI-WDT501 watchdog board then you can enable the temperature sensor by setting the type parameter to 501.  If you want to enable the Fan Tachometer on the PCI-WDT501, then you can do this via the tachometer parameter. Only do this if you have a fan tachometer actually set up.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called wdt_pci.
I2C_MPC;If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the built-in I2C interface on the MPC107, Tsi107, MPC512x, MPC52xx, MPC8240, MPC8245, MPC83xx, MPC85xx and MPC8641 family processors.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called i2c-mpc.

ACPI_BUTTON;This driver handles events on the power, sleep, and lid buttons. A daemon reads events from input devices or via netlink and performs user-defined actions such as shutting down the system. This is necessary for software-controlled poweroff.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called button.
EEPROM_IDT_89HPESX;Enable this driver to get read/write access to EEPROM / CSRs over IDT PCIe-swtich i2c-slave interface.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called idt_89hpesx.
USB_MASS_STORAGE;The Mass Storage Gadget acts as a USB Mass Storage disk drive. As its storage repository it can use a regular file or a block device (in much the same way as the loop device driver), specified as a module parameter or sysfs option.  This driver is a replacement for now removed File-backed Storage Gadget (g_file_storage).  Say y to link the driver statically, or m to build a dynamically linked module called g_mass_storage.
GCOV_KERNEL;This option enables gcov-based code profiling (e.g. for code coverage measurements).  If unsure, say N.

This option allows for unused exported symbols to be dropped from the build. In turn, this provides the compiler more opportunities (especially when using LTO) for optimizing the code and reducing binary size.  This might have some security advantages as well.  If unsure, or if you need to build out-of-tree modules, say N.

CFG80211_REG_RELAX_NO_IR;This option enables support for relaxation of the NO_IR flag for situations that certain regulatory bodies have provided clarifications on how relaxation can occur. This feature has an inherent dependency on userspace features which must have been properly tested and as such is not enabled by default.  A relaxation feature example is allowing the operation of a P2P group owner (GO) on channels marked with NO_IR if there is an additional BSS interface which associated to an AP which userspace assumes or confirms to be an authorized master, i.e., with radar detection support and DFS capabilities. However, note that in order to not create daisy chain scenarios, this relaxation is not allowed in cases where the BSS client is associated to P2P GO and in addition the P2P GO instantiated on a channel due to this relaxation should not allow connection from non P2P clients.  The regulatory core will apply these relaxations only for drivers that support this feature by declaring the appropriate channel flags and capabilities in their registration flow.
BOOTPARAM_HOTPLUG_CPU0;Set whether default state of cpu0_hotpluggable is on or off.  Say Y here to enable CPU0 hotplug by default. If this switch is turned on, there is no need to give cpu0_hotplug kernel parameter and the CPU0 hotplug feature is enabled by default.  Please note: there are two known CPU0 dependencies if you want to enable the CPU0 hotplug feature either by this switch or by cpu0_hotplug kernel parameter.  First, resume from hibernate or suspend always starts from CPU0. So hibernate and suspend are prevented if CPU0 is offline.  Second dependency is PIC interrupts always go to CPU0. CPU0 can not offline if any interrupt can not migrate out of CPU0. There may be other CPU0 dependencies.  Please make sure the dependencies are under your control before you enable this feature.  Say N if you don't want to enable CPU0 hotplug feature by default. You still can enable the CPU0 hotplug feature at boot by kernel parameter cpu0_hotplug.

Without these, those machine used to have the hard disk on hdc and the CD-ROM on hda. This option changes this to more natural hda for hard disk and hdc for CD-ROM.
SCSI_SYM53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS;This is the default value of the command queue depth the driver will announce to the generic SCSI layer for devices that support tagged command queueing. This value can be changed from the boot command line.  This is a soft limit that cannot exceed CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_MAX_TAGS.
RADIO_GEMTEK_PORT;Enter either 0x20c, 0x30c, 0x24c, 0x34c, 0x248 or 0x28c here. The card default is 0x34c, if you haven't changed the jumper setting on the card.  On Sound Vision 16 Gold PnP with FM Radio (ESS1869+FM Gemtek), the I/O port is 0x20c, 0x248 or 0x28c.  If automatic I/O port probing is enabled this port will be used only in case of automatic probing failure, ie. as a fallback.

SECCOMP;This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications that may need to compute untrusted bytecode during their execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is enabled via prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP), it cannot be disabled and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls defined by each seccomp mode.  If unsure, say Y. Only embedded should say N here.
GPIO_SYSFS;Say Y here to add a sysfs interface for GPIOs.  This is mostly useful to work around omissions in a system's kernel support.  Those are common in custom and semicustom hardware assembled using standard kernels with a minimum of custom patches.  In those cases, userspace code may import a given GPIO from the kernel, if no kernel driver requested it.  Kernel drivers may also request that a particular GPIO be exported to userspace. this can be useful when debugging.
DEBUG_WX;Generate a warning if any W+X mappings are found at boot.  This is useful for discovering cases where the kernel is leaving W+X mappings after applying NX, as such mappings are a security risk.  Look for a message in dmesg output like this:    x86/mm: Checked W+X mappings: passed, no W+X pages found.  or like this, if the check failed:    x86/mm: Checked W+X mappings: FAILED, <N> W+X pages found.  Note that even if the check fails, your kernel is possibly still fine, as W+X mappings are not a security hole in themselves, what they do is that they make the exploitation of other unfixed kernel bugs easier.  There is no runtime or memory usage effect of this option once the kernel has booted up - it's a one time check.  If in doubt, say Y.
RTC_DRV_S35390A;If you say yes here you will get support for the Seiko Instruments S-35390A.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so the module will be called rtc-s35390a.

Such devices include the ATI remote that comes with many of ATI's All-In-Wonder video cards, the X10 Lola remote, NVIDIA RF remote, Medion RF remote, and SnapStream FireFly remote.  This driver provides mouse pointer, left and right mouse buttons, and maps all the other remote buttons to keypress events.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ati_remote.
W1_SLAVE_DS2433_CRC;Say Y here to protect DS2433 data with a CRC16. Each block has 30 bytes of data and a two byte CRC16. Full block writes are only allowed if the CRC is valid.
IP_VS_SED;The shortest expected delay scheduling algorithm assigns network connections to the server with the shortest expected delay. The  expected delay that the job will experience is (Ci + 1) / Ui if  sent to the ith server, in which Ci is the number of connections on the ith server and Ui is the fixed service rate (weight) of the ith server.  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. To compile it as a module, choose M here. If unsure, say N.
IR_IGUANA;Say Y here if you want to use the IguanaWorks USB IR Transceiver. Both infrared receive and send are supported.

SECURITY_APPARMOR_DEBUG_MESSAGES;Set the default value of the apparmor.debug kernel parameter. When enabled, various debug messages will be logged to the kernel message buffer.
THERMAL_EMERGENCY_POWEROFF_DELAY_MS;Thermal subsystem will issue a graceful shutdown when critical temperatures are reached using orderly_poweroff(). In case of failure of an orderly_poweroff(), the thermal emergency poweroff kicks in after a delay has elapsed and shuts down the system. This config is number of milliseconds to delay before emergency poweroff kicks in. Similarly to the critical trip point, the delay should be carefully profiled so as to give adequate time for orderly_poweroff() to finish on regular execution. If set to 0 emergency poweroff will not be supported.  In doubt, leave as 0.
INIT_ALL_POSSIBLE;Back when each arch used to define their own cpu_online_mask and cpu_possible_mask, some of them chose to initialize cpu_possible_mask with all 1s, and others with all 0s.  When they were centralised, it was better to provide this option than to break all the archs and have several arch maintainers pursuing me down dark alleys.
SCSI_MESH_SYNC_RATE;On Power Macintoshes (and clones) where the MESH SCSI bus adaptor drives a bus which is entirely internal to the machine (such as the 7500, 7600, 8500, etc.), the MESH is capable of synchronous operation at up to 10 MB/s. On machines where the SCSI bus controlled by the MESH can have external devices connected, it is usually rated at 5 MB/s. 5 is a safe value here unless you know the MESH SCSI bus is internal only. in that case you can say 10. Say 0 to disable synchronous operation.
BRANCH_TRACER;This traces the events of likely and unlikely condition calls in the kernel.  The difference between this and the Trace likely/unlikely profiler is that this is not a histogram of the callers, but actually places the calling events into a running trace buffer to see when and where the events happened, as well as their results.  Say N if unsure.
L2TP_ETH;Support for carrying raw ethernet frames over L2TPv3.  From RFC 4719 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4719.txt>.  The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, Version 3 (L2TPv3) can be used as a control protocol and for data encapsulation to set up Pseudowires for transporting layer 2 Packet Data Units across an IP network [RFC3931].  This driver provides an ethernet virtual interface for each L2TP ethernet pseudowire instance. Standard Linux tools may be used to assign an IP address to the local virtual interface, or add the interface to a bridge.  If you are using L2TPv3, you will almost certainly want to enable this option.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will be called l2tp_eth.
RTC_DRV_TPS6586X;TI Power Management IC TPS6586X supports RTC functionality along with alarm. This driver supports the RTC driver for the TPS6586X RTC module.

BATMAN_ADV_DAT;This option enables DAT (Distributed ARP Table), a DHT based mechanism that increases ARP reliability on sparse wireless mesh networks. If you think that your network does not need this option you can safely remove it and save some space.
X86_RESERVE_LOW;Specify the amount of low memory to reserve for the BIOS.  The first page contains BIOS data structures that the kernel must not use, so that page must always be reserved.  By default we reserve the first 64K of physical RAM, as a number of BIOSes are known to corrupt that memory range during events such as suspend/resume or monitor cable insertion, so it must not be used by the kernel.  You can set this to 4 if you are absolutely sure that you trust the BIOS to get all its memory reservations and usages right.  If you know your BIOS have problems beyond the default 64K area, you can set this to 640 to avoid using the entire low memory range.  If you have doubts about the BIOS (e.g. suspend/resume does not work or there's kernel crashes after certain hardware hotplug events) then you might want to enable X86_CHECK_BIOS_CORRUPTION=y to allow the kernel to check typical corruption patterns.  Leave this to the default value of 64 if you are unsure.
IGB_HWMON;Say Y if you want to expose thermal sensor data on Intel devices.  Some of our devices contain thermal sensors, both external and internal. This data is available via the hwmon sysfs interface and exposes the onboard sensors.

EFS_FS;EFS is an older file system used for non-ISO9660 CD-ROMs and hard disk partitions by SGI's IRIX operating system (IRIX 6.0 and newer uses the XFS file system for hard disk partitions however).  This implementation only offers read-only access. If you don't know what all this is about, it's safe to say N. For more information about EFS see its home page at <http://aeschi.ch.eu.org/efs/>.  To compile the EFS file system support as a module, choose M here: the module will be called efs.
MAX1363;Say yes here to build support for many Maxim i2c analog to digital converters (ADC).

SYN_COOKIES;Normal TCP/IP networking is open to an attack known as SYN flooding. This denial-of-service attack prevents legitimate remote users from being able to connect to your computer during an ongoing attack and requires very little work from the attacker, who can operate from anywhere on the Internet.  SYN cookies provide protection against this type of attack. If you say Y here, the TCP/IP stack will use a cryptographic challenge protocol known as SYN cookies to enable legitimate users to continue to connect, even when your machine is under attack. There is no need for the legitimate users to change their TCP/IP software. SYN cookies work transparently to them. For technical information about SYN cookies, check out <http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html>.  If you are SYN flooded, the source address reported by the kernel is likely to have been forged by the attacker. it is only reported as an aid in tracing the packets to their actual source and should not be taken as absolute truth.  SYN cookies may prevent correct error reporting on clients when the server is really overloaded. If this happens frequently better turn them off.  If you say Y here, you can disable SYN cookies at run time by saying Y to /proc file system support and Sysctl support below and executing the command  echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies  after the /proc file system has been mounted.  If unsure, say N.
JFFS2_CMODE_NONE;Uses no compression.
RT2800SOC;This adds support for Ralink WiSoC devices. Supported chips: RT2880, RT3050, RT3052, RT3350, RT3352.  When compiled as a module, this driver will be called rt2800soc.
SPI_RB4XX;SPI controller driver for the Mikrotik RB4xx series boards.
ITCO_VENDOR_SUPPORT;Add vendor specific support to the intel TCO timer based watchdog devices. At this moment we only have additional support for some SuperMicro Inc. motherboards.
CRYPTO_DRBG_HASH;Enable the Hash DRBG variant as defined in NIST SP800-90A.
RAS_CEC;This is a small cache which collects correctable memory errors per 4K page PFN and counts their repeated occurrence. Once the counter for a PFN overflows, we try to soft-offline that page as we take it to mean that it has reached a relatively high error count and would probably be best if we don't use it anymore.  Bear in mind that this is absolutely useless if your platform doesn't have ECC DIMMs and doesn't have DRAM ECC checking enabled in the BIOS.
XFS_RT;If you say Y here you will be able to mount and use XFS filesystems which contain a realtime subvolume.  The realtime subvolume is a separate area of disk space where only file data is stored.  It was originally designed to provide deterministic data rates suitable for media streaming applications, but is also useful as a generic mechanism for ensuring data and metadata/log I/Os are completely separated.  Regular file I/Os are isolated to a separate device from all other requests, and this can be done quite transparently to applications via the inherit-realtime directory inode flag.  See the xfs man page in section 5 for additional information.  If unsure, say N.
IP_SET_MAX;You can define here default value of the maximum number  of IP sets for the kernel.  The value can be overridden by the 'max_sets' module parameter of the 'ip_set' module.
PATA_OF_PLATFORM;This option enables support for generic directly connected ATA devices commonly found on embedded systems with OpenFirmware bindings.  If unsure, say N.
INTEL_IOMMU_BROKEN_GFX_WA;Current Graphics drivers tend to use physical address for DMA and avoid using DMA APIs. Setting this config option permits the IOMMU driver to set a unity map for all the OS-visible memory. Hence the driver can continue to use physical addresses for DMA, at least until this option is removed in the 2.6.32 kernel.
ELECTRA_CF;Say Y here to support the CompactFlash controller on the PA Semi Electra eval board.
NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_TPROXY;This option adds a `TPROXY' target, which is somewhat similar to REDIRECT.  It can only be used in the mangle table and is useful to redirect traffic to a transparent proxy.  It does _not_ depend on Netfilter connection tracking and NAT, unlike REDIRECT. For it to work you will have to configure certain iptables rules and use policy routing. For more information on how to set it up see Documentation/networking/tproxy.txt.  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
HZ_250;250 Hz is a good compromise choice allowing server performance while also showing good interactive responsiveness even on SMP and NUMA systems. If you are going to be using NTSC video or multimedia, selected 300Hz instead.
SND_USB_US122L;Say Y here to include support for Tascam US-122L USB Audio/MIDI interfaces.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called snd-usb-us122l.

PATA_MPIIX;This option enables support for MPIIX PATA support.  If unsure, say N.
NFT_REDIR_IPV6;This is the expression that provides IPv4 redirect support for nf_tables.
DM_ZONED;This device-mapper target takes a host-managed or host-aware zoned block device and exposes most of its capacity as a regular block device (drive-managed zoned block device) without any write constraints. This is mainly intended for use with file systems that do not natively support zoned block devices but still want to benefit from the increased capacity offered by SMR disks. Other uses by applications using raw block devices (for example object stores) are also possible.  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called dm-zoned.  If unsure, say N.
NFT_REDIR_IPV4;This is the expression that provides IPv4 redirect support for nf_tables.
MFD_PALMAS;If you say yes here you get support for the Palmas series of PMIC chips from Texas Instruments.
GCC_PLUGIN_RANDSTRUCT;If you say Y here, the layouts of structures explicitly marked by __randomize_layout will be randomized at compile-time.  This can introduce the requirement of an additional information exposure vulnerability for exploits targeting these structure types.  Enabling this feature will introduce some performance impact, slightly increase memory usage, and prevent the use of forensic tools like Volatility against the system (unless the kernel source tree isn't cleaned after kernel installation).  The seed used for compilation is located at scripts/gcc-plgins/randomize_layout_seed.h.  It remains after a make clean to allow for external modules to be compiled with the existing seed and will be removed by a make mrproper or make distclean.  Note that the implementation requires gcc 4.7 or newer.  This plugin was ported from grsecurity/PaX. More information at:  * https://grsecurity.net/  * https://pax.grsecurity.net/
X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ_CPB;The powernow-k8 driver used to provide a sysfs knob called cpb to disable the Core Performance Boosting feature of AMD CPUs. This file has now been superseded by the more generic boost entry.  By enabling this option the acpi_cpufreq driver provides the old entry in addition to the new boost ones, for compatibility reasons.
LEDS_TRIGGER_DISK;This allows LEDs to be controlled by disk activity. If unsure, say Y.
JFFS2_LZO;minilzo-based compression. Generally works better than Zlib.  This feature was added in July, 2007. Say 'N' if you need compatibility with older bootloaders or kernels.
SCSI_PMCRAID;This driver supports the PMC SIERRA MaxRAID adapters.
CAN;Controller Area Network (CAN) is a slow (up to 1Mbit/s) serial communications protocol which was developed by Bosch in 1991, mainly for automotive, but now widely used in marine (NMEA2000), industrial, and medical applications. More information on the CAN network protocol family PF_CAN is contained in <Documentation/networking/can.txt>.  If you want CAN support you should say Y here and also to the specific driver for your controller(s) below.
NO_HZ;This is the old config entry that enables dynticks idle. We keep it around for a little while to enforce backward compatibility with older config files.

HAVE_ALIGNED_STRUCT_PAGE;This makes sure that struct pages are double word aligned and that e.g. the SLUB allocator can perform double word atomic operations on a struct page for better performance. However selecting this might increase the size of a struct page by a word.
LEDS_NS2;This option enables support for the dual-GPIO LEDs found on the following LaCie/Seagate boards:        Network Space v2 (and parents: Max, Mini)       Internet Space v2       d2 Network v2       n090401 (Seagate NAS 4-Bay)
SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC;The SCSI subsystem can probe for devices while the rest of the system continues booting, and even probe devices on different busses in parallel, leading to a significant speed-up.  You can override this choice by specifying scsi_mod.scan=sync or async on the kernel's command line.  Note that this setting also affects whether resuming from system suspend will be performed asynchronously.
CAN_SUN4I;Say Y here if you want to use CAN controller found on Allwinner A10/A20 SoCs.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sun4i_can.
WLAN_VENDOR_BROADCOM;If you have a wireless card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about  cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.

To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ucsi_acpi
ZSMALLOC;zsmalloc is a slab-based memory allocator designed to store compressed RAM pages.  zsmalloc uses virtual memory mapping in order to reduce fragmentation.  However, this results in a non-standard allocator interface where a handle, not a pointer, is returned by an alloc().  This handle must be mapped in order to access the allocated space.
HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF;The arch chooses to use the generic perf-NMI-based hardlockup detector. Must define HAVE_PERF_EVENTS_NMI.
KEYBOARD_MPR121;Say Y here if you have Freescale MPR121 touchkey controller chip in your system.  If unsure, say N.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called mpr121_touchkey.

SCSI_SYM53C416;This is support for the sym53c416 SCSI host adapter, the SCSI adapter that comes with some HP scanners. This driver requires that the sym53c416 is configured first using some sort of PnP configuration program (e.g. isapnp) or by a PnP aware BIOS. If you are using isapnp then you need to compile this driver as a module and then load it using insmod after isapnp has run. The parameters of the configured card(s) should be passed to the driver. The format is:  insmod sym53c416 sym53c416=<base>,<irq> [sym53c416_1=<base>,<irq>]  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sym53c416.

IPW2100;A driver for the Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 Network  Connection 802.11b wireless network adapter.  See <file:Documentation/networking/README.ipw2100> for information on the capabilities currently enabled in this driver and for tips for debugging issues and problems.  In order to use this driver, you will need a firmware image for it. You can obtain the firmware from <http://ipw2100.sf.net/>.  Once you have the firmware image, you  will need to place it in /lib/firmware.  You will also very likely need the Wireless Tools in order to configure your card:  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.  It is recommended that you compile this driver as a module (M) rather than built-in (Y). This driver requires firmware at device initialization time, and when built-in this typically happens before the filesystem is accessible (hence firmware will be unavailable and initialization will fail). If you do choose to build this driver into your kernel image, you can avoid this problem by including the firmware and a firmware loader in an initramfs.
RTC_DRV_PCF2123;If you say yes here you get support for the NXP PCF2123 RTC chip.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called rtc-pcf2123.

SND_ATMEL_SOC_WM8904;Say Y if you want to add support for Atmel ASoC driver for boards using WM8904 codec.
L2TP_IP;Support for L2TP-over-IP socket family.  The L2TPv3 protocol defines two possible encapsulations for L2TP frames, namely UDP and plain IP (without UDP). This driver provides a new L2TPIP socket family with which userspace L2TPv3 daemons may create L2TP/IP tunnel sockets when UDP encapsulation is not required. When L2TP is carried in IP packets, it used IP protocol number 115, so this port must be enabled in firewalls.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will be called l2tp_ip.
MISDN_L1OIP;Enable support for ISDN over IP tunnel.  It features:   - dynamic IP exchange, if one or both peers have dynamic IPs   - BRI (S0) and PRI (S2M) interface   - layer 1 control via network keepalive frames   - direct tunneling of physical interface via IP  NOTE: This protocol is called 'Layer 1 over IP' and is not compatible with ISDNoIP (Agfeo) or TDMoIP. Protocol description is provided in the source code.

KSM;Enable Kernel Samepage Merging: KSM periodically scans those areas of an application's address space that an app has advised may be mergeable.  When it finds pages of identical content, it replaces the many instances by a single page with that content, so saving memory until one or another app needs to modify the content. Recommended for use with KVM, or with other duplicative applications. See Documentation/vm/ksm.txt for more information: KSM is inactive until a program has madvised that an area is MADV_MERGEABLE, and root has set /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run to 1 (if CONFIG_SYSFS is set).
DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS;Say Y to verify that the per_cpu map being accessed has been set up. This adds a fair amount of code to kernel memory and decreases performance.  Say N if unsure.
RCU_NOCB_CPU;Use this option to reduce OS jitter for aggressive HPC or real-time workloads.  It can also be used to offload RCU callback invocation to energy-efficient CPUs in battery-powered asymmetric multiprocessors.  This option offloads callback invocation from the set of CPUs specified at boot time by the rcu_nocbs parameter. For each such CPU, a kthread (rcuox/N) will be created to invoke callbacks, where the N is the CPU being offloaded, and where the x is b for RCU-bh, p for RCU-preempt, and s for RCU-sched.  Nothing prevents this kthread from running on the specified CPUs, but (1) the kthreads may be preempted between each callback, and (2) affinity or cgroups can be used to force the kthreads to run on whatever set of CPUs is desired.  Say Y here if you want to help to debug reduced OS jitter. Say N here if you are unsure.

USB_CONFIGFS_F_UAC1;This Audio function implements 1 AudioControl interface, 1 AudioStreaming Interface each for USB-OUT and USB-IN. This driver doesn't expect any real Audio codec to be present on the device - the audio streams are simply sinked to and sourced from a virtual ALSA sound card created. The user-space application may choose to do whatever it wants with the data received from the USB Host and choose to provide whatever it wants as audio data to the USB Host.
USB_CONFIGFS_F_UAC2;This Audio function is compatible with USB Audio Class specification 2.0. It implements 1 AudioControl interface, 1 AudioStreaming Interface each for USB-OUT and USB-IN.

RSI_DEBUGFS;Say Y, if you would like to enable debug support. This option creates debugfs entries
X86_EXTENDED_PLATFORM;If you disable this option then the kernel will only support standard PC platforms. (which covers the vast majority of systems out there.)  If you enable this option then you'll be able to select support for the following (non-PC) 64 bit x86 platforms:       Numascale NumaChip       ScaleMP vSMP       SGI Ultraviolet  If you have one of these systems, or if you want to build a generic distribution kernel, say Y here - otherwise say N.

STRICT_DEVMEM;If this option is disabled, you allow userspace (root) access to all of memory, including kernel and userspace memory. Accidental access to this is obviously disastrous, but specific access can be used by people debugging the kernel. Note that with PAT support enabled, even in this case there are restrictions on /dev/mem use due to the cache aliasing requirements.  If this option is switched on, and IO_STRICT_DEVMEM=n, the /dev/mem file only allows userspace access to PCI space and the BIOS code and data regions.  This is sufficient for dosemu and X and all common users of /dev/mem.  If in doubt, say Y.
PARAVIRT_TIME_ACCOUNTING;Select this option to enable fine granularity task steal time accounting. Time spent executing other tasks in parallel with the current vCPU is discounted from the vCPU power. To account for that, there can be a small performance impact.  If in doubt, say N here.

D-Link DSB-650C and DU-E10 Entrega / Portgear E45 I-O DATA USB-ET/T Jaton USB Ethernet Device Adapter Kingston Technology USB Ethernet Adapter Linksys USB10T Mobility USB-Ethernet Adapter NetGear EA-101 Peracom Enet and Enet2 Portsmith Express Ethernet Adapter Shark Pocket Adapter SMC 2202USB Sony Vaio port extender  This driver is likely to work with most 10Mbps only USB Ethernet adapters, including some no brand devices. It does NOT work on SmartBridges smartNIC or on Belkin F5U111 devices - you should use the CATC NetMate driver for those. If you are not sure which one you need, select both, and the correct one should be selected for you.  This driver makes the adapter appear as a normal Ethernet interface, typically on eth0, if it is the only ethernet device, or perhaps on eth1, if you have a PCI or ISA ethernet card installed.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called kaweth.
SENSORS_W83627HF;If you say yes here you get support for the Winbond W836X7 series of sensor chips: the W83627HF, W83627THF, W83637HF, W83687THF and W83697HF.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called w83627hf.
DMA_SHARED_BUFFER;This option enables the framework for buffer-sharing between multiple drivers. A buffer is associated with a file using driver APIs extension. the file's descriptor can then be passed on to other driver.
HID_PENMOUNT;This selects a driver for the PenMount 6000 touch controller.  The driver works around a problem in the report descript allowing the userspace to touch events instead of mouse events.  Say Y here if you have a Penmount based touch controller.

CRYPTO_LZ4;This is the LZ4 algorithm.
PERF_EVENTS;Enable kernel support for various performance events provided by software and hardware.  Software events are supported either built-in or via the use of generic tracepoints.  Most modern CPUs support performance events via performance counter registers. These registers count the number of certain types of hw events: such as instructions executed, cachemisses suffered, or branches mis-predicted - without slowing down the kernel or applications. These registers can also trigger interrupts when a threshold number of events have passed - and can thus be used to profile the code that runs on that CPU.  The Linux Performance Event subsystem provides an abstraction of these software and hardware event capabilities, available via a system call and used by the perf utility in tools/perf/. It provides per task and per CPU counters, and it provides event capabilities on top of those.  Say Y if unsure.
HAVE_CONTEXT_TRACKING;Provide kernel/user boundaries probes necessary for subsystems that need it, such as userspace RCU extended quiescent state. Syscalls need to be wrapped inside user_exit()-user_enter() through the slow path using TIF_NOHZ flag. Exceptions handlers must be wrapped as well. Irqs are already protected inside rcu_irq_enter/rcu_irq_exit() but preemption or signal handling on irq exit still need to be protected.
POWER_RESET_AT91_RESET;This driver supports restart for Atmel AT91SAM9 and SAMA5 SoCs
NET_NS;Allow user space to create what appear to be multiple instances of the network stack.
THINKPAD_ACPI_HOTKEY_POLL;Some thinkpad models benefit from NVRAM polling to detect a few of the hot key press events.  If you know your ThinkPad model does not need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use, unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access IBM, Zoom, Switch Display (fn+F7), ThinkLight, Volume up/down/mute, Brightness up/down, Display Expand (fn+F8), Hibernate (fn+F12).  If you are not sure, say Y here.  The driver enables polling only if it is strictly necessary to do so.

CRYPTO_LZO;This is the LZO algorithm.
DEBUG_GPIO;Say Y here to add some extra checks and diagnostics to GPIO calls. These checks help ensure that GPIOs have been properly initialized before they are used, and that sleeping calls are not made from non-sleeping contexts.  They can make bitbanged serial protocols slower.  The diagnostics help catch the type of setup errors that are most common when setting up new platforms or boards.
MFD_AS3711;Support for the AS3711 PMIC from AMS
INTEL_TURBO_MAX_3;This driver reads maximum performance ratio of each CPU and set up the scheduler priority metrics. In this way scheduler can prefer CPU with higher performance to schedule tasks. This driver is only required when the system is not using Hardware P-States (HWP). In HWP mode, priority can be read from ACPI tables.
REISERFS_FS;Stores not just filenames but the files themselves in a balanced tree.  Uses journalling.  Balanced trees are more efficient than traditional file system architectural foundations.  In general, ReiserFS is as fast as ext2, but is very efficient with large directories and small files.  Additional patches are needed for NFS and quotas, please see  <https://reiser4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page> for links.  It is more easily extended to have features currently found in database and keyword search systems than block allocation based file systems are.  The next version will be so extended, and will support plugins consistent with our motto ``It takes more than a license to make source code open.''  Read <https://reiser4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page>  to learn more about reiserfs.  Sponsored by Threshold Networks, Emusic.com, and Bigstorage.com.  If you like it, you can pay us to add new features to it that you need, buy a support contract, or pay us to port it to another OS.
NET_SCH_FQ;Say Y here if you want to use the FQ packet scheduling algorithm.  FQ does flow separation, and is able to respect pacing requirements set by TCP stack into sk->sk_pacing_rate (for localy generated traffic)  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sch_fq.  If unsure, say N.

This architecture provides the infrastructure to support simplified sharing of networking interfaces and accelerators by multiple CPUs. The major h/w blocks composing DPAA are BMan and QMan.  The Buffer Manager (BMan) is a hardware buffer pool management block that allows software and accelerators on the datapath to acquire and release buffers in order to build frames.  The Queue Manager (QMan) is a hardware queue management block that allows software and accelerators on the datapath to enqueue and dequeue frames in order to communicate.
USB_SIERRA_NET;Choose this option if you have a Sierra Wireless USB-to-WWAN device.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sierra_net.
MFD_SM501;This is the core driver for the Silicon Motion SM501 multimedia companion chip. This device is a multifunction device which may provide numerous interfaces including USB host controller, USB gadget, asynchronous serial ports, audio functions, and a dual display video interface. The device may be connected by PCI or local bus with varying functions enabled.

NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_DCCP;With this option enabled, you will be able to use the iptables `dccp' match in order to match on DCCP source/destination ports and DCCP flags.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.
ARM_S3C24XX_CPUFREQ_DEBUGFS;Export status information via debugfs.
TMPFS_POSIX_ACL;POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) support additional access rights for users and groups beyond the standard owner/group/world scheme, and this option selects support for ACLs specifically for tmpfs filesystems.  If you've selected TMPFS, it's possible that you'll also need this option as there are a number of Linux distros that require POSIX ACL support under /dev for certain features to work properly. For example, some distros need this feature for ALSA-related /dev files for sound to work properly.  In short, if you're not sure, say Y.  To learn more about Access Control Lists, visit the POSIX ACLs for Linux website <http://acl.bestbits.at/>.
MAX1118;Say yes here to build support for Maxim max1117/max1118/max1119 8-bit, dual-channel ADCs.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called max1118.

IPV6_GRE;Tunneling means encapsulating data of one protocol type within another protocol and sending it over a channel that understands the encapsulating protocol. This particular tunneling driver implements GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) and at this time allows encapsulating of IPv4 or IPv6 over existing IPv6 infrastructure. This driver is useful if the other endpoint is a Cisco router: Cisco likes GRE much better than the other Linux tunneling driver (IP tunneling above). In addition, GRE allows multicast redistribution through the tunnel.  Saying M here will produce a module called ip6_gre. If unsure, say N.
SND_SOC_TEGRA20_DAS;Say Y or M if you want to add support for the Tegra20 DAS module. You will also need to select the individual machine drivers to support below.
GPIO_104_IDIO_16;Enables GPIO support for the ACCES 104-IDIO-16 family (104-IDIO-16, 104-IDIO-16E, 104-IDO-16, 104-IDIO-8, 104-IDIO-8E, 104-IDO-8). The base port addresses for the devices may be configured via the base module parameter. The interrupt line numbers for the devices may be configured via the irq module parameter.
SCSI_IZIP_SLOW_CTR;Some parallel ports are known to have excessive delays between changing the parallel port control register and good data being available on the parallel port data/status register. This option forces a small delay (1.0 usec to be exact) after changing the control register to let things settle out. Enabling this option may result in a big drop in performance but some very old parallel ports (found in 386 vintage machines) will not work properly.  Generally, saying N is fine.
VIDEO_PVRUSB2_DEBUGIFC;This option enables the inclusion of a debug interface in the pvrusb2 driver, hosted through sysfs.  You do not need to select this option unless you plan on debugging the driver or performing a manual firmware extraction.  If you are in doubt, say N.

W1_MASTER_GPIO;Say Y here if you want to communicate with your 1-wire devices using GPIO pins. This driver uses the GPIO API to control the wire.  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module will be called w1-gpio.
X86_POWERNOW_K8;This adds the CPUFreq driver for K8/early Opteron/Athlon64 processors. Support for K10 and newer processors is now in acpi-cpufreq.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called powernow-k8.  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.
DVB_USB_TTUSB2;Say Y here to support the Pinnacle 400e DVB-S USB2.0 receiver and the TechnoTrend CT-3650 CI DVB-C/T USB2.0 receiver. The firmware protocol used by this module is similar to the one used by the old ttusb-driver - that's why the module is called dvb-usb-ttusb2.
X86_POWERNOW_K7;This adds the CPUFreq driver for mobile AMD K7 mobile processors.  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.  If in doubt, say N.
X86_POWERNOW_K6;This adds the CPUFreq driver for mobile AMD K6-2+ and mobile AMD K6-3+ processors.  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.  If in doubt, say N.

RTC_DRV_ASM9260;If you say yes here you get support for the RTC on the Alphascale asm9260 SoC.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called rtc-asm9260.
INTEL_MIC_HOST;This enables Host Driver support for the Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) family of PCIe form factor coprocessor devices that run a 64 bit Linux OS. The driver manages card OS state and enables communication between host and card. Intel MIC X100 devices are currently supported.  If you are building a host kernel with an Intel MIC device then say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.  More information about the Intel MIC family as well as the Linux OS and tools for MIC to use with this driver are available from <http://software.intel.com/en-us/mic-developer>.
NET_SCH_PLUG;This queuing discipline allows userspace to plug/unplug a network output queue, using the netlink interface.  When it receives an enqueue command it inserts a plug into the outbound queue that causes following packets to enqueue until a dequeue command arrives over netlink, causing the plug to be removed and resuming the normal packet flow.  This module also provides a generic network output buffering functionality (aka output commit), wherein upon arrival of a dequeue command, only packets up to the first plug are released for delivery. The Remus HA project uses this module to enable speculative execution of virtual machines by allowing the generated network output to be rolled back if needed.  For more information, please refer to <http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Remus>  Say Y here if you are using this kernel for Xen dom0 and want to protect Xen guests with Remus.  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sch_plug.

KVM_DEBUG_FS;This option enables collection of various statistics for KVM guest. Statistics are displayed in debugfs filesystem. Enabling this option may incur significant overhead.
NET_SCH_ATM;Say Y here if you want to use the ATM pseudo-scheduler.  This provides a framework for invoking classifiers, which in turn select classes of this queuing discipline.  Each class maps the flow(s) it is handling to a given virtual circuit.  See the top of <file:net/sched/sch_atm.c> for more details.  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sch_atm.
MTD_PARTITIONED_MASTER;For historical reasons, by default, either a master is present or several partitions are present, but not both. The concern was that data listed in multiple partitions was dangerous. however, SCSI does this and it is frequently useful for applications. This config option leaves the master in even if the device is partitioned. It also makes the parent of the partition device be the master device, rather than what lies behind the master.
HAVE_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER;See Documentation/trace/ftrace-design.txt
SPIDER_NET;This driver supports the Gigabit Ethernet chips present on the Cell Processor-Based Blades from IBM.
TSL2583;Provides support for the TAOS tsl2580, tsl2581 and tsl2583 devices. Access ALS data via iio, sysfs.
PPP_DEFLATE;Support for the Deflate compression method for PPP, which uses the Deflate algorithm (the same algorithm that gzip uses) to compress each PPP packet before it is sent over the wire.  The machine at the other end of the PPP link (usually your ISP) has to support the Deflate compression method as well for this to be useful.  Even if they don't support it, it is safe to say Y here.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.
NET_VENDOR_NUVOTON;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about Nuvoton cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
INPUT_DRV260X_HAPTICS;Say Y to enable support for the TI DRV260X haptics driver.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called drv260x-haptics.

ATM_FORE200E_TX_RETRY;Specifies the number of times the driver attempts to transmit a message before giving up, if the transmit queue of the ATM card is transiently saturated.  Saturation of the transmit queue may occur only under extreme conditions, e.g. when a fast host continuously submits very small frames (<64 bytes) or raw AAL0 cells (48 bytes) to the ATM adapter.  Note that under common conditions, it is unlikely that you encounter a saturation of the transmit queue, so the retry mechanism never comes into play.

This may be specified as a module argument (kernel command line argument as well?), changed dynamically using an ioctl (not yet) or changed by sending the string Dxxxx to VCI 1023 (where x is a hex digit).  See the file <file:drivers/atm/ambassador.h> for the meanings of the bits in the mask.  When active, these messages can have a significant impact on the speed of the driver, and the size of your syslog files! When inactive, they will have only a modest impact on performance.
MMA8452;Say yes here to build support for the following Freescale / NXP 3-axis accelerometers: MMA8451Q, MMA8452Q, MMA8453Q, MMA8652FC, MMA8653FC, FXLS8471Q.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called mma8452.

The VUB300 chip supports SD and MMC memory cards in addition to single and multifunction SDIO cards.  Some SDIO cards will need a firmware file to be loaded and sent to VUB300 chip in order to achieve better data throughput. Download these Offload Pseudocode from Elan Digital Systems' web-site http://www.elandigitalsystems.com/support/downloads.php and put them in /lib/firmware. Note that without these additional firmware files the VUB300 chip will still function, but not at the best obtainable data rate.  To compile this mmc host controller driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called vub300.  If you have a computer with an embedded VUB300 chip or if you intend connecting a USB adapter based on a VUB300 chip say Y or M here.
SYNC_FILE;The Sync File Framework adds explicit syncronization via userspace. It enables send/receive 'struct dma_fence' objects to/from userspace via Sync File fds for synchronization between drivers via userspace components. It has been ported from Android.  The first and main user for this is graphics in which a fence is associated with a buffer. When a job is submitted to the GPU a fence is attached to the buffer and is transferred via userspace, using Sync Files fds, to the DRM driver for example. More details at Documentation/sync_file.txt.
ZD1211RW;This is a driver for the ZyDAS ZD1211/ZD1211B wireless chip, present in many USB-wireless adapters.  Device firmware is required alongside this driver. You can download the firmware distribution from http://sf.net/projects/zd1211/files/

BALLOON_COMPACTION;Memory fragmentation introduced by ballooning might reduce significantly the number of 2MB contiguous memory blocks that can be used within a guest, thus imposing performance penalties associated with the reduced number of transparent huge pages that could be used by the guest workload. Allowing the compaction & migration for memory pages enlisted as being part of memory balloon devices avoids the scenario aforementioned and helps improving memory defragmentation.
CIFS_DEBUG2;Enabling this option adds a few more debugging routines to the cifs code which slightly increases the size of the cifs module and can cause additional logging of debug messages in some error paths, slowing performance. This option can be turned off unless you are debugging cifs problems.  If unsure, say N.
MMC_SPI;Some systems access MMC/SD/SDIO cards using a SPI controller instead of using a native MMC/SD/SDIO controller.  This has a disadvantage of being relatively high overhead, but a compensating advantage of working on many systems without dedicated MMC/SD/SDIO controllers.  If unsure, or if your system has no SPI master driver, say N.
ATM_SOLOS;Support for the Solos multiport ADSL2+ card.

People who might say N here are those that are setting up dedicated Ethernet WWW/FTP servers, or users that have one of the various bus mice instead of a serial mouse and don't intend to use their machine's standard serial port for anything.  (Note that the Cyclades multi serial port driver does not need this driver built in for it to work.)  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called 8250. [WARNING: Do not compile this driver as a module if you are using non-standard serial ports, since the configuration information will be lost when the driver is unloaded.  This limitation may be lifted in the future.]  BTW1: If you have a mouseman serial mouse which is not recognized by the X window system, try running gpm first.  BTW2: If you intend to use a software modem (also called Winmodem) under Linux, forget it.  These modems are crippled and require proprietary drivers which are only available under Windows.  Most people will say Y or M here, so that they can use serial mice, modems and similar devices connecting to the standard serial ports.

ARM_PSCI_CHECKER;Run the PSCI checker during startup. This checks that hotplug and suspend operations work correctly when using PSCI.  The torture tests may interfere with the PSCI checker by turning CPUs on and off through hotplug, so for now torture tests and PSCI checker are mutually exclusive.
NET_CADENCE;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  If unsure, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the remaining Atmel network card questions. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
RCU_FANOUT_LEAF;This option controls the leaf-level fanout of hierarchical implementations of RCU, and allows trading off cache misses against lock contention.  Systems that synchronize their scheduling-clock interrupts for energy-efficiency reasons will want the default because the smaller leaf-level fanout keeps lock contention levels acceptably low.  Very large systems (hundreds or thousands of CPUs) will instead want to set this value to the maximum value possible in order to reduce the number of cache misses incurred during RCU's grace-period initialization.  These systems tend to run CPU-bound, and thus are not helped by synchronized interrupts, and thus tend to skew them, which reduces lock contention enough that large leaf-level fanouts work well.  That said, setting leaf-level fanout to a large number will likely cause problematic lock contention on the leaf-level rcu_node structures unless you boot with the skew_tick kernel parameter.  Select a specific number if testing RCU itself.  Select the maximum permissible value for large systems, but please understand that you may also need to set the skew_tick kernel boot parameter to avoid contention on the rcu_node structure's locks.  Take the default if unsure.
MACSONIC;Support for NatSemi SONIC based Ethernet devices.  This includes the onboard Ethernet in many Quadras as well as some LC-PDS, a few Nubus and all known Comm Slot Ethernet cards.

KEXEC;kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot but it is independent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not initially work for you.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

The size of the kernel is about 30% smaller with XZ in comparison to gzip. On architectures for which there is a BCJ filter (i386, x86_64, ARM, IA-64, PowerPC, and SPARC), XZ will create a few percent smaller kernel than plain LZMA.  The speed is about the same as with LZMA: The decompression speed of XZ is better than that of bzip2 but worse than gzip and LZO. Compression is slow.
INTEL_MFLD_THERMAL;Say Y here to enable thermal driver support for the  Intel Medfield platform.
PCIPCWATCHDOG;This is the driver for the Berkshire Products PCI-PC Watchdog card.

Will only work with lower half only trigger consumers.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called iio-trig-loop.
USB_SERIAL_CONSOLE;If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a USB to serial converter port as the system console (the system console is the device which receives all kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected to that serial port.  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as console=ttyUSB0. (Try man bootparam or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the kernel will automatically use the first USB to serial converter port, /dev/ttyUSB0, as system console.  If unsure, say N.

If this option is disabled:    - block device files will become unusable   - some filesystems (such as ext3) will become unavailable.  Also, SCSI character devices and USB storage will be disabled since they make use of various block layer definitions and facilities.  Say Y here unless you know you really don't want to mount disks and suchlike.
HID_MAYFLASH;Say Y here if you have HJZ Mayflash PS3 game controller adapters and want to enable force feedback support.
THINKPAD_ACPI_UNSAFE_LEDS;Overriding LED state on ThinkPads can mask important firmware alerts (like critical battery condition), or misled the user into damaging the hardware (undocking or ejecting the bay while buses are still active), etc.  LED control on the ThinkPad is write-only (with very few exceptions on very ancient models), which makes it impossible to know beforehand if important information will be lost when one changes LED state.  Users that know what they are doing can enable this option and the driver will allow control of every LED, including the ones on the dock stations.  Never enable this option on a distribution kernel.  Say N here, unless you are building a kernel for your own use, and need to control the important firmware LEDs.

SOUND_DMAP;Linux can often have problems allocating DMA buffers for ISA sound cards on machines with more than 16MB of RAM. This is because ISA DMA buffers must exist below the 16MB boundary and it is quite possible that a large enough free block in this region cannot be found after the machine has been running for a while. If you say Y here the DMA buffers (64Kb) will be allocated at boot time and kept until the shutdown. This option is only useful if you said Y to OSS sound modules, above. If you said M to OSS sound modules then you can get the persistent DMA buffer functionality by passing the command-line argument dmabuf=1 to the sound module.  Say Y unless you have 16MB or more RAM or a PCI sound card.
BLK_DEV_QD65XX;This driver is enabled at runtime using the qd65xx.probe kernel boot parameter.  It permits faster I/O speeds to be set.  See the <file:Documentation/ide/ide.txt> and <file:drivers/ide/qd65xx.c> for more info.

AMIGA_PARTITION;Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which were partitioned under AmigaOS.
RADIO_MIROPCM20;Choose Y here if you have this FM radio card. You also need to enable the ALSA sound system. This choice automatically selects the ALSA sound card driver Miro miroSOUND PCM1pro/PCM12/PCM20radio as this is required for the radio-miropcm20.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called radio-miropcm20.
KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC;This integer controls the behaviour of kdb when the kernel gets a catastrophic error, i.e. for a panic or oops. When KDB is active and a catastrophic error occurs, nothing extra will happen until you type 'go'. CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 0 (default). The first time you type 'go', you will be warned by kdb. The secend time you type 'go', KDB tries to continue. No guarantees that the kernel is still usable in this situation. CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 1. KDB tries to continue. No guarantees that the kernel is still usable in this situation. CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 2. KDB forces a reboot. If you are not sure, say 0.
PLX_HERMES;Enable support for PCMCIA cards supported by the Hermes (aka orinoco) driver when used in PLX9052 based PCI adaptors.  These adaptors are not a full PCMCIA controller but act as a more limited PCI <-> PCMCIA bridge.  Several vendors sell such adaptors so that 802.11b PCMCIA cards can be used in desktop machines.  The Netgear MA301 is such an adaptor.
RTC_DRV_MSM6242;If you say yes here you get support for the Oki MSM6242 timekeeping chip. It is used in some Amiga models (e.g. A2000).  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called rtc-msm6242.
USB_GSPCA_XIRLINK_CIT;Say Y here if you want support for Xirlink C-It bases cameras.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called gspca_xirlink_cit.
USB_SERIAL_EDGEPORT_TI;Say Y here if you want to use any of the devices from Inside Out Networks (Digi) that are not supported by the io_edgeport driver. This includes the Edgeport/1 device.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called io_ti.
IWLEGACY_DEBUG;This option will enable debug tracing output for the iwlegacy drivers.  This will result in the kernel module being ~100k larger.  You can control which debug output is sent to the kernel log by setting the value in        /sys/class/net/wlan0/device/debug_level  This entry will only exist if this option is enabled.  To set a value, simply echo an 8-byte hex value to the same file:          % echo 0x43fff > /sys/class/net/wlan0/device/debug_level  You can find the list of debug mask values in:         drivers/net/wireless/iwlegacy/common.h  If this is your first time using this driver, you should say Y here as the debug information can assist others in helping you resolve any problems you may encounter.
SERIAL_8250_OMAP_TTYO_FIXUP;This option replaces the console=ttyO argument with the matching ttyS argument if the user did not specified it on the command line. This ensures that the user can see the kernel output during boot which he wouldn't see otherwise. The getty has still to be configured for ttyS instead of ttyO regardless of this option. This option is intended for people who automatically enable this driver without knowing that this driver requires a different console= argument. If you read this, please keep this option disabled and instead update your kernel command line. If you prepare a kernel for a distribution or other kind of larger user base then you probably want to keep this option enabled. Otherwise people might complain about a not booting kernel because the serial console remains silent in case they forgot to update the command line.
CRYPTO_BLOWFISH_X86_64;Blowfish cipher algorithm (x86_64), by Bruce Schneier.  This is a variable key length cipher which can use keys from 32 bits to 448 bits in length.  It's fast, simple and specifically designed for use on large microprocessors.  See also: <http://www.schneier.com/blowfish.html>
MMC_RICOH_MMC;This adds a pci quirk to disable Ricoh MMC Controller. This proprietary controller is unnecessary because the SDHCI driver supports MMC cards on the SD controller, but if it is not disabled, it will steal the MMC cards away - rendering them useless. It is safe to select this even if you don't have a Ricoh based card reader.  If unsure, say Y.
EARLY_PRINTK_DBGP;Write kernel log output directly into the EHCI debug port.  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation it is not recommended because it looks ugly and doesn't cooperate with klogd/syslogd or the X server. You should normally say N here, unless you want to debug such a crash. You need usb debug device.
SLHC;This option enables Van Jacobsen serial line header compression routines.
CLK_BCM_NS2;Enable common clock framework support for the Broadcom Northstar 2 SoC

SERIAL_MCF;This serial driver supports the Freescale Coldfire serial ports.
EFI_MAX_FAKE_MEM;Maximum allowable number of ranges in efi_fake_mem boot option. Ranges can be set up to this value using comma-separated list. The default value is 8.
DEFXX_MMIO;This instructs the driver to use EISA or PCI memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) as appropriate instead of programmed I/O ports (PIO). Enabling this gives an improvement in processing time in parts of the driver, but it may cause problems with EISA (DEFEA) adapters.  TURBOchannel does not have the concept of I/O ports, so MMIO is always used for these (DEFTA) adapters.  If unsure, say N.
IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE_ARMV7S;Enable support for the ARM Short-descriptor pagetable format. This supports 32-bit virtual and physical addresses mapped using 2-level tables with 4KB pages/1MB sections, and contiguous entries for 64KB pages/16MB supersections if indicated by the IOMMU driver.
SERIAL_SIRFSOC;Support for the on-chip UART on the CSR SiRFprimaII series, providing /dev/ttySiRF0, 1 and 2 (note, some machines may not provide all of these ports, depending on how the serial port pins are configured).
INET_ESP_OFFLOAD;Support for ESP transformation offload. This makes sense only if this system really does IPsec and want to do it with high throughput. A typical desktop system does not need it, even if it does IPsec.  If unsure, say N.
ENABLE_WARN_DEPRECATED;Enable the __deprecated logic in the kernel build. Disable this to suppress the warning: 'foo' is deprecated (declared at kernel/power/somefile.c:1234) messages.
NF_CONNTRACK_IPV6;Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related into connections.

To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
USB_AMD5536UDC;The AMD5536 UDC is part of the AMD Geode CS5536, an x86 southbridge. It is a USB Highspeed DMA capable USB device controller. Beside ep0 it provides 4 IN and 4 OUT endpoints (bulk or interrupt type). The UDC port supports OTG operation, and may be used as a host port if it's not being used to implement peripheral or OTG roles.  This UDC is based on Synopsys USB device controller IP and selects CONFIG_USB_SNP_CORE option to build the core driver.  Say y to link the driver statically, or m to build a dynamically linked module called amd5536udc and force all gadget drivers to also be dynamically linked.
BACKLIGHT_HP700;If you have an HP Jornada 700 series, say Y to include backlight control driver.
THERMAL_GOV_BANG_BANG;Enable this to manage platform thermals using bang bang governor.  Say 'Y' here if you want to use two point temperature regulation used for fans without throttling.  Some fan drivers depend on this governor to be enabled (e.g. acerhdf).
NET_VENDOR_FUJITSU;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the the questions about Fujitsu cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
SERIAL_BFIN_SPORT3_UART_CTSRTS;Enable hardware flow control in the driver.
TEGRA_SOCTHERM;Enable this option for integrated thermal management support on NVIDIA Tegra systems-on-chip. The driver supports four thermal zones (CPU, GPU, MEM, PLLX).

ADT7316_SPI;Say yes here to build SPI bus support for Analog Devices ADT7316/7/8 and ADT7516/7/9.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called adt7316_spi.
FB_CFB_FILLRECT;Include the cfb_fillrect function for generic software rectangle filling. This is used by drivers that don't provide their own (accelerated) version.
GPIO_PCI_IDIO_16;Enables GPIO support for the ACCES PCI-IDIO-16. An interrupt is generated when any of the inputs change state (low to high or high to low). Input filter control is not supported by this driver, and the input filters are deactivated by this driver.
REGULATOR;Generic Voltage and Current Regulator support.  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface to voltage and current regulators within the Linux kernel. It's intended to provide voltage and current control to client or consumer drivers and also provide status information to user space applications through a sysfs interface.  The intention is to allow systems to dynamically control regulator output in order to save power and prolong battery life. This applies to both voltage regulators (where voltage output is controllable) and current sinks (where current output is controllable).  This framework safely compiles out if not selected so that client drivers can still be used in systems with no software controllable regulators.  If unsure, say no.
RADIO_TEA5764;Say Y here if you want to use the TEA5764 FM chip found in EZX phones. This FM chip is present in EZX phones from Motorola, connected to internal pxa I2C bus.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called radio-tea5764.

CLK_BCM_NSP;Enable common clock framework support for the Broadcom Northstar and Northstar Plus SoCs
INTEL_RST;This driver provides support for modifying paramaters on systems equipped with Intel's Rapid Start Technology. When put in an ACPI sleep state, these devices will wake after either a configured timeout or when the system battery reaches a critical state, automatically copying memory contents to disk. On resume, the firmware will copy the memory contents back to RAM and resume the OS as usual.
VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API;Enables the V4L2 sub-device pad-level userspace API used to configure video format, size and frame rate between hardware blocks.  This API is mostly used by camera interfaces in embedded platforms.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called radio-typhoon.
AHCI_CEVA;This option enables support for the CEVA AHCI SATA. It can be found on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC.  If unsure, say N.
6LOWPAN_NHC_FRAGMENT;6LoWPAN IPv6 Fragment Header compression according to RFC6282.
WIRELESS_WDS;This option enables the deprecated WDS support, the newer mac80211-based 4-addr AP/client support supersedes it with a much better feature set (HT, VHT, ...)  We plan to remove this option and code, so if you find that you have to enable it, please let us know on the linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org mailing list, so we can help you migrate to 4-addr AP/client (or, if it's really necessary, give up on our plan of removing it).
SND_SOC_PHYCORE_AC97;Say Y if you want to add support for SoC audio on Phytec phyCORE and phyCARD boards in AC97 mode
SPEAKUP_SYNTH_DECPC;This is the Speakup driver for the DecTalk PC (full length ISA) synthesizer.  You can say m to build it as a module.  See the configuration help on the Speakup choice above for more info.  In order to use the DecTalk PC driver, you must download the dec_pc.tgz file from linux-speakup.org.  It is in the pub/linux/goodies directory.  The dec_pc.tgz file contains the software which must be pre-loaded on to the DecTalk PC board in order to use it with this driver.

SCSI_FLASHPOINT;This option allows you to add FlashPoint support to the BusLogic SCSI driver. The FlashPoint SCCB Manager code is substantial, so users of MultiMaster Host Adapters may not wish to include it.
SPI_OMAP_100K;OMAP SPI 100K master controller for omap7xx boards.
BT_HCIBTUART;Bluetooth HCI UART (PC Card) driver. This driver provides support for Bluetooth PCMCIA devices with an UART interface:    Xircom CreditCard Bluetooth Adapter    Xircom RealPort2 Bluetooth Adapter    Sphinx PICO Card    H-Soft blue+Card    Cyber-blue Compact Flash Card  Say Y here to compile support for HCI UART devices into the kernel or say M to compile it as module (btuart_cs).

PHY_ROCKCHIP_USB;Enable this to support the Rockchip USB 2.0 PHY.
NET_DSA;Say Y if you want to enable support for the hardware switches supported by the Distributed Switch Architecture.
IO_STRICT_DEVMEM;If this option is disabled, you allow userspace (root) access to all io-memory regardless of whether a driver is actively using that range.  Accidental access to this is obviously disastrous, but specific access can be used by people debugging kernel drivers.  If this option is switched on, the /dev/mem file only allows userspace access to *idle* io-memory ranges (see /proc/iomem) This may break traditional users of /dev/mem (dosemu, legacy X, etc...) if the driver using a given range cannot be disabled.  If in doubt, say Y.
I2C_HELPER_AUTO;Some I2C bus drivers require so-called I2C algorithm modules to work. These are basically software-only abstractions of generic I2C interfaces. This option will autoselect them so that you don't have to care.  Unselect this only if you need to enable additional helper modules, for example for use with external I2C bus drivers.  In doubt, say Y.
COMEDI_ICP_MULTI;Enable support for Inova ICP_MULTI card  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called icp_multi.

EDAC_I3200;Support for error detection and correction on the Intel 3200 and 3210 server chipsets.
FSI_MASTER_GPIO;This option enables a FSI master driver using GPIO lines.
SUSPEND_FREEZER;This allows you to turn off the freezer for suspend. If this is done, no tasks are frozen for suspend to RAM/standby.  Turning OFF this setting is NOT recommended! If in doubt, say Y.
CRASH_DUMP;Generate crash dump after being started by kexec. This should be normally only set in special crash dump kernels which are loaded in the main kernel with kexec-tools into a specially reserved region and then later executed after a crash by kdump/kexec. The crash dump kernel must be compiled to a memory address not used by the main kernel or BIOS using PHYSICAL_START, or it must be built as a relocatable image (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y). For more details see Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt
BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE;This framework adds support for low-level control of the LCD backlight. This includes support for brightness and power.  To have support for your specific LCD panel you will have to select the proper drivers which depend on this option.
AF_RXRPC_DEBUG;Say Y here to make runtime controllable debugging messages appear.  See Documentation/networking/rxrpc.txt.
PRISM54;This enables support for FullMAC PCI/Cardbus prism54 devices. This driver is now deprecated in favor for the SoftMAC driver, p54pci. p54pci supports FullMAC PCI/Cardbus devices as well.  For more information refer to the p54 wiki:  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/p54  Note: You need a motherboard with DMA support to use any of these cards  When built as module you get the module prism54

BINFMT_MISC;If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python, .NET or Emacs-Lisp. It's also useful if you often run DOS executables under the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>). Once you have registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt. Linux will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file <file:Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt> to learn how to use this feature, <file:Documentation/admin-guide/java.rst> for information about how to include Java support. and <file:Documentation/admin-guide/mono.rst> for information about how to include Mono-based .NET support.  To use binfmt_misc, you will need to mount it:       mount binfmt_misc -t binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when you have use for it. the module is called binfmt_misc. If you don't know what to answer at this point, say Y.

RAS;Reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) is a computer hardware engineering term. Computers designed with higher levels of RAS have a multitude of features that protect data integrity and help them stay available for long periods of time without failure.  Reliability can be defined as the probability that the system will produce correct outputs up to some given time. Reliability is enhanced by features that help to avoid, detect and repair hardware faults.  Availability is the probability a system is operational at a given time, i.e. the amount of time a device is actually operating as the percentage of total time it should be operating.  Serviceability or maintainability is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained. if the time to repair a failed system increases, then availability will decrease.  Note that Reliability and Availability are distinct concepts: Reliability is a measure of the ability of a system to function correctly, including avoiding data corruption, whereas Availability measures how often it is available for use, even though it may not be functioning correctly. For example, a server may run forever and so have ideal availability, but may be unreliable, with frequent data corruption.

LEDS_INTEL_SS4200;This option enables support for the Intel SS4200 series of Network Attached Storage servers. You may control the hard drive or power LEDs on the front panel. Using this driver can stop the front LED from blinking after startup.
LOG_CPU_MAX_BUF_SHIFT;This option allows to increase the default ring buffer size according to the number of CPUs. The value defines the contribution of each CPU as a power of 2. The used space is typically only few lines however it might be much more when problems are reported, e.g. backtraces.  The increased size means that a new buffer has to be allocated and the original static one is unused. It makes sense only on systems with more CPUs. Therefore this value is used only when the sum of contributions is greater than the half of the default kernel ring buffer as defined by LOG_BUF_SHIFT. The default values are set so that more than 64 CPUs are needed to trigger the allocation.  Also this option is ignored when log_buf_len kernel parameter is used as it forces an exact (power of two) size of the ring buffer.  The number of possible CPUs is used for this computation ignoring hotplugging making the computation optimal for the worst case scenario while allowing a simple algorithm to be used from bootup.  Examples shift values and their meaning:            17 => 128 KB for each CPU            16 =>  64 KB for each CPU            15 =>  32 KB for each CPU            14 =>  16 KB for each CPU            13 =>   8 KB for each CPU            12 =>   4 KB for each CPU

Like 6to4, it utilizes stateless IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation in order to transit IPv4-only network infrastructure.  Unlike 6to4, a 6rd service provider uses an IPv6 prefix of its own in place of the fixed 6to4 prefix.  With this option enabled, the SIT driver offers 6rd functionality by providing additional ioctl API to configure the IPv6 Prefix for in stead of static 2002::/16 for 6to4.  If unsure, say N.

PINCTRL_IMX25;Say Y here to enable the imx25 pinctrl driver
PINCTRL_IMX21;Say Y here to enable the i.MX21 pinctrl driver
VIRTIO_PCI_LEGACY;Virtio PCI Card 0.9.X Draft (circa 2014) and older device support.  This option enables building a transitional driver, supporting both devices conforming to Virtio 1 specification, and legacy devices. If disabled, you get a slightly smaller, non-transitional driver, with no legacy compatibility.  So look out into your driveway.  Do you have a flying car?  If so, you can happily disable this option and virtio will not break.  Otherwise, leave it set.  Unless you're testing what life will be like in The Future.  If unsure, say Y.
PCIE_XILINX;Say 'Y' here if you want kernel to support the Xilinx AXI PCIe Host Bridge driver.
BATTERY_TWL4030_MADC;Say Y here to enable this dumb driver for batteries managed through the TWL4030 MADC.

LED_TRIGGER_PHY;Adds support for a set of LED trigger events per-PHY.  Link state change will trigger the events, for consumption by an LED class driver.  There are triggers for each link speed currently supported by the phy, and are of the form:      <mii bus id>:<phy>:<speed>  Where speed is in the form:       <Speed in megabits>Mbps or <Speed in gigabits>Gbps
B44;If you have a network (Ethernet) controller of this type, say Y or M here.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will be called b44.
ISCSI_IBFT_FIND;This option enables the kernel to find the region of memory in which the ISCSI Boot Firmware Table (iBFT) resides. This is necessary for iSCSI Boot Firmware Table Attributes module to work properly.
B43;b43 is a driver for the Broadcom 43xx series wireless devices.  Check lspci for something like Broadcom Corporation BCM43XX 802.11 Wireless LAN Controller to determine whether you own such a device.  This driver supports the new BCM43xx IEEE 802.11G devices, but not the old IEEE 802.11B devices. Old devices are supported by the b43legacy driver. Note that this has nothing to do with the standard that your AccessPoint supports (A, B, G or a combination). IEEE 802.11G devices can talk to IEEE 802.11B AccessPoints.  It is safe to include both b43 and b43legacy as the underlying glue layer will automatically load the correct version for your device.  This driver uses V4 firmware, which must be installed separately using b43-fwcutter.  This driver can be built as a module (recommended) that will be called b43. If unsure, say M.
IOSCHED_CFQ;The CFQ I/O scheduler tries to distribute bandwidth equally among all processes in the system. It should provide a fair and low latency working environment, suitable for both desktop and server systems.  This is the default I/O scheduler.
AGP_UNINORTH;This option gives you AGP support for Apple machines with a UniNorth or U3 (Apple G5) bridge.
PINCTRL_MDM9615;This is the pinctrl, pinmux, pinconf and gpiolib driver for the Qualcomm TLMM block found in the Qualcomm 9615 platform.

EDAC_LAYERSCAPE;Support for error detection and correction on Freescale memory controllers on Layerscape SoCs.
EARLY_PRINTK_USB_XDBC;Write kernel log output directly into the xHCI debug port.  One use for this feature is kernel debugging, for example when your machine crashes very early before the regular console code is initialized. Other uses include simpler, lockless logging instead of a full-blown printk console driver + klogd.  For normal production environments this is normally not recommended, because it doesn't feed events into klogd/syslogd and doesn't try to print anything on the screen.  You should normally say N here, unless you want to debug early crashes or need a very simple printk logging facility.
MTD_NAND_OXNAS;This enables the NAND flash controller on Oxford Semiconductor SoCs.
X25;X.25 is a set of standardized network protocols, similar in scope to frame relay. the one physical line from your box to the X.25 network entry point can carry several logical point-to-point connections (called virtual circuits) to other computers connected to the X.25 network. Governments, banks, and other organizations tend to use it to connect to each other or to form Wide Area Networks (WANs). Many countries have public X.25 networks. X.25 consists of two protocols: the higher level Packet Layer Protocol (PLP) (say Y here if you want that) and the lower level data link layer protocol LAPB (say Y to LAPB Data Link Driver below if you want that).  You can read more about X.25 at <http://www.sangoma.com/tutorials/x25/> and <http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/X.25>. Information about X.25 for Linux is contained in the files <file:Documentation/networking/x25.txt> and <file:Documentation/networking/x25-iface.txt>.  One connects to an X.25 network either with a dedicated network card using the X.21 protocol (not yet supported by Linux) or one can do X.25 over a standard telephone line using an ordinary modem (say Y to X.25 async driver below) or over Ethernet using an ordinary Ethernet card and the LAPB over Ethernet (say Y to LAPB Data Link Driver and LAPB over Ethernet driver below).  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called x25. If unsure, say N.
88EU_AP_MODE;This option enables Access Point mode. Unless you know that your system will never be used as an AP, or the target system has limited memory, Y should be selected.
PWM_BCM_IPROC;Generic PWM framework driver for Broadcom iProc PWM block. This block is used in Broadcom iProc SoC's.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called pwm-bcm-iproc.

KEYBOARD_HP6XX;Say Y here if you have a HP Jornada 620/660/680/690 and want to support the built-in keyboard.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called jornada680_kbd.
HERMES_CACHE_FW_ON_INIT;Say Y to cache any firmware required by the Hermes drivers on startup.  The firmware will remain cached until the driver is unloaded.  The cache uses 64K of RAM.  Otherwise load the firmware from userspace as required.  In this case the driver should be unloaded and restarted whenever the firmware is changed.  If you are not sure, say Y.
SND_SOC_ROCKCHIP_RT5645;Say Y or M here if you want to add support for SoC audio on Rockchip boards using the RT5645/RT5650 codec, such as Veyron.
NOHIGHMEM;Linux can use up to 64 Gigabytes of physical memory on x86 systems. However, the address space of 32-bit x86 processors is only 4 Gigabytes large. That means that, if you have a large amount of physical memory, not all of it can be permanently mapped by the kernel. The physical memory that's not permanently mapped is called high memory.  If you are compiling a kernel which will never run on a machine with more than 1 Gigabyte total physical RAM, answer off here (default choice and suitable for most users). This will result in a 3GB/1GB split: 3GB are mapped so that each process sees a 3GB virtual memory space and the remaining part of the 4GB virtual memory space is used by the kernel to permanently map as much physical memory as possible.  If the machine has between 1 and 4 Gigabytes physical RAM, then answer 4GB here.  If more than 4 Gigabytes is used then answer 64GB here. This selection turns Intel PAE (Physical Address Extension) mode on. PAE implements 3-level paging on IA32 processors. PAE is fully supported by Linux, PAE mode is implemented on all recent Intel processors (Pentium Pro and better). NOTE: If you say 64GB here, then the kernel will not boot on CPUs that don't support PAE!  The actual amount of total physical memory will either be auto detected or can be forced by using a kernel command line option such as mem=256M. (Try man bootparam or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  If unsure, say off.
FAIL_PAGE_ALLOC;Provide fault-injection capability for alloc_pages().
CPU_SUP_CYRIX_32;This enables detection, tunings and quirks for Cyrix processors  You need this enabled if you want your kernel to run on a Cyrix CPU. Disabling this option on other types of CPUs makes the kernel a tiny bit smaller. Disabling it on a Cyrix CPU might render the kernel unbootable.  If unsure, say N.
IPMI_SSIF;Provides a driver for a SMBus interface to a BMC, meaning that you have a driver that must be accessed over an I2C bus instead of a standard interface.  This module requires I2C support.
IIO_SW_DEVICE;Provides IIO core support for software devices. A software device can be created via configfs or directly by a driver using the API provided.
SERIAL_AMBA_PL010_CONSOLE;Say Y here if you wish to use an AMBA PrimeCell UART as the system console (the system console is the device which receives all kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode).  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible framebuffer console (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as console=ttyAM0. (Try man bootparam or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)
SENSORS_MAX31790;If you say yes here you get support for 6-Channel PWM-Output Fan RPM Controller.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called max31790.
MOUSE_ATIXL;Say Y here if your mouse is of the ATI XL variety.
HAVE_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN;With VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN, cputime_t becomes 64-bit. Before enabling this option, arch code must be audited to ensure there are no races in concurrent read/write of cputime_t. For example, reading/writing 64-bit cputime_t on some 32-bit arches may require multiple accesses, so proper locking is needed to protect against concurrent accesses.
PSS_HAVE_BOOT;If you have the DSPxxx.LD file or SYNTH.LD file for you card, say Y to include this file. Without this file the synth device (OPL) may not work.
NF_CONNTRACK_NETBIOS_NS;NetBIOS name service requests are sent as broadcast messages from an unprivileged port and responded to with unicast messages to the same port. This make them hard to firewall properly because connection tracking doesn't deal with broadcasts. This helper tracks locally originating NetBIOS name service requests and the corresponding responses. It relies on correct IP address configuration, specifically netmask and broadcast address. When properly configured, the output of ip address show should look similar to this:  $ ip -4 address show eth0 4: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000     inet 172.16.2.252/24 brd 172.16.2.255 scope global eth0  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
XFS_ASSERT_FATAL;Set the default DEBUG mode ASSERT failure behavior.  Say Y here to cause DEBUG mode ASSERT failures to result in fatal errors that BUG() the kernel by default. If you say N, ASSERT failures result in warnings.  This behavior can be modified at runtime via sysfs.
RTC_DRV_TWL4030;If you say yes here you get support for the RTC on the TWL4030/TWL5030/TWL6030 family chips, used mostly with OMAP3 platforms.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called rtc-twl.
TOUCHSCREEN_SX8654;Say Y here if you have a Semtech SX8654 touchscreen controller.  If unsure, say N  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sx8654.
BT_HCIUART_QCA;The Qualcomm Atheros protocol supports HCI In-Band Sleep feature over serial port interface(H4) between controller and host. This protocol is required for UART clock control for QCA Bluetooth devices.  Say Y here to compile support for QCA protocol.
COMMON_CLK_MT6797;This driver supports Mediatek MT6797 basic clocks.
PNPBIOS_PROC_FS;If you say Y here and to /proc file system support, you will be able to directly access the PNPBIOS.  This includes resource allocation, ESCD, and other PNPBIOS services.  Using this interface is potentially dangerous because the PNPBIOS driver will not be notified of any resource changes made by writing directly. Also some buggy systems will fault when accessing certain features in the PNPBIOS /proc interface (e.g. boot configs).  See the latest pcmcia-cs (stand-alone package) for a nice set of PNPBIOS /proc interface tools (lspnp and setpnp).  Unless you are debugging or have other specific reasons, it is recommended that you say N here.
MTD_UBI_FASTMAP;Important: this feature is experimental so far and the on-flash format for fastmap may change in the next kernel versions  Fastmap is a mechanism which allows attaching an UBI device in nearly constant time. Instead of scanning the whole MTD device it only has to locate a checkpoint (called fastmap) on the device. The on-flash fastmap contains all information needed to attach the device. Using fastmap makes only sense on large devices where attaching by scanning takes long. UBI will not automatically install a fastmap on old images, but you can set the UBI module parameter fm_autoconvert to 1 if you want so. Please note that fastmap-enabled images are still usable with UBI implementations without fastmap support. On typical flash devices the whole fastmap fits into one PEB. UBI will reserve PEBs to hold two fastmaps.  If in doubt, say N.
BATMAN_ADV_BLA;This option enables BLA (Bridge Loop Avoidance), a mechanism to avoid Ethernet frames looping when mesh nodes are connected to both the same LAN and the same mesh. If you will never use more than one mesh node in the same LAN, you can safely remove this feature and save some space.

HVC_OPAL;PowerNV machines running under OPAL need that driver to get a console
WATCHDOG_HANDLE_BOOT_ENABLED;The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say Y here) is to ping watchdog devices that were enabled before the driver has been loaded until control is taken over from userspace using the /dev/watchdog file. If you say N here, the kernel will not update the watchdog on its own. Thus if your userspace does not start fast enough your device will reboot.
ATH9K_DEBUGFS;Say Y, if you need access to ath9k's statistics for interrupts, rate control, etc.  Also required for changing debug message flags at run time. As well as access to the FFT/spectral data and TX99.

IPV6_PIMSM_V2;Support for IPv6 PIM multicast routing protocol PIM-SMv2. If unsure, say N.
SERIAL_RP2;This driver supports the Comtrol RocketPort EXPRESS and RocketPort INFINITY families of PCI/PCIe multiport serial adapters. These adapters use a RocketPort 2 ASIC that is not compatible with the original RocketPort driver (CONFIG_ROCKETPORT).  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called rp2.  If you want to compile this driver into the kernel, say Y here.  If you don't have a suitable RocketPort card installed, say N.
WL12XX;This module adds support for wireless adapters based on TI wl1271, wl1273, wl1281 and wl1283 chipsets. This module does *not* include support for wl1251.  For wl1251 support, use the separate homonymous  driver instead.

SLIP_COMPRESSED;This protocol is faster than SLIP because it uses compression on the TCP/IP headers (not on the data itself), but it has to be supported on both ends. Ask your access provider if you are not sure and answer Y, just in case. You will still be able to use plain SLIP. If you plan to use SLiRP, the SLIP emulator (available from <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection, you definitely want to say Y here. The NET-3-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to configure CSLIP. This won't enlarge your kernel.

X86_16BIT;This option is required by programs like Wine to run 16-bit protected mode legacy code on x86 processors.  Disabling this option saves about 300 bytes on i386, or around 6K text plus 16K runtime memory on x86-64,
IDE_GENERIC;This is the generic IDE driver.  This driver attaches to the fixed legacy ports (e.g. on PCs 0x1f0/0x170, 0x1e8/0x168 and so on).  Please note that if this driver is built into the kernel or loaded before other ATA (IDE or libata) drivers and the controller is located at legacy ports, this driver may grab those ports and thus can prevent the controller specific driver from attaching.  Also, currently, IDE generic doesn't allow IRQ sharing meaning that the IRQs it grabs won't be available to other controllers sharing those IRQs which usually makes drivers for those controllers fail.  Generally, it's not a good idea to load IDE generic driver on modern systems.  If unsure, say N.
AB3100_OTP;Select this to enable the AB3100 Mixed Signal IC OTP (one-time programmable memory) support. This exposes a sysfs file to read out OTP values.
B53_MMAP_DRIVER;Select to enable support for memory-mapped switches like the BCM63XX integrated switches.

Note that using this driver in concert with efibootmgr requires at least test release version 0.5.0-test3 or later, which is available from: <http://linux.dell.com/efibootmgr/testing/efibootmgr-0.5.0-test3.tar.gz>  Subsequent efibootmgr releases may be found at: <http://github.com/vathpela/efibootmgr>
NET_VENDOR_SEEQ;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about SEEQ devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
GPIO_EM;Say yes here to support GPIO on Renesas Emma Mobile SoCs.
DVB_PLATFORM_DRIVERS;Say Y here to enable support for platform-specific Digital TV drivers.

QCOM_IRQ_COMBINER;Say yes here to add support for the IRQ combiner devices embedded in Qualcomm Technologies chips.
USB_EHCI_MV;Enables support for Marvell (including PXA and MMP series) on-chip USB SPH and OTG controller. SPH is a single port host, and it can only be EHCI host. OTG is controller that can switch to host mode. Note that this driver will not work on Marvell's other EHCI controller used by the EBU-type SoCs including Orion, Kirkwood, Dova, Armada 370 and Armada XP. See Support for Marvell EBU on-chip EHCI USB controller for those.
THUNDER_NIC_PF;This driver supports Thunder's NIC physical function. The NIC provides the controller and DMA engines to move network traffic to/from the memory. The NIC works closely with TNS, BGX and SerDes to implement the functions replacing and virtualizing those of a typical standalone PCIe NIC chip.
VIDEO_PVRUSB2_DVB;This option enables a DVB interface for the pvrusb2 driver. If your device does not support digital television, this feature will have no affect on the driver's operation.  If you are in doubt, say Y.
NLS_ISO8859_9;If you want to display filenames with native language characters from the Microsoft FAT file system family or from JOLIET CD-ROMs correctly on the screen, you need to include the appropriate input/output character sets. Say Y here for the Latin 5 character set, and it replaces the rarely needed Icelandic letters in Latin 1 with the Turkish ones. Useful in Turkey.

It is also the default for the US. If unsure, say Y.
VT_CONSOLE;The system console is the device which receives all kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode. If you answer Y here, a virtual terminal (the device used to interact with a physical terminal) can be used as system console. This is the most common mode of operations, so you should say Y here unless you want the kernel messages be output only to a serial port (in which case you should say Y to Console on serial port, below).  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual terminal (/dev/tty0) will be used as system console. You can change that with a kernel command line option such as console=tty3 which would use the third virtual terminal as system console. (Try man bootparam or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  If unsure, say Y.
NLS_ISO8859_2;If you want to display filenames with native language characters from the Microsoft FAT file system family or from JOLIET CD-ROMs correctly on the screen, you need to include the appropriate input/output character sets.

ACQUIRE_WDT;This is the driver for the hardware watchdog on Single Board Computers produced by Acquire Inc (and others). This watchdog simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze, and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of time.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called acquirewdt.  Most people will say N.
AHCI_OCTEON;This option enables support for Cavium Octeon SoC Serial ATA.  If unsure, say N.

This particular tunneling driver implements GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) and at this time allows encapsulating of IPv4 or IPv6 over existing IPv4 infrastructure. This driver is useful if the other endpoint is a Cisco router: Cisco likes GRE much better than the other Linux tunneling driver (IP tunneling above). In addition, GRE allows multicast redistribution through the tunnel.
LCD_HP700;If you have an HP Jornada 700 series handheld (710/720/728) say Y to enable LCD control driver.
PCI_KEYSTONE;Say Y here if you want to enable PCI controller support on Keystone SoCs. The PCI controller on Keystone is based on Designware hardware and therefore the driver re-uses the Designware core functions to implement the driver.

USB_ULPI_BUS;UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) is specification for a commonly used USB 2.0 PHY interface. The ULPI specification defines a standard set of registers that can be used to detect the vendor and product which allows ULPI to be handled as a bus. This module is the driver for that bus.  The ULPI interfaces (the buses) are registered by the drivers for USB controllers which support ULPI register access and have ULPI PHY attached to them. The ULPI PHY drivers themselves are normal PHY drivers.  ULPI PHYs provide often functions such as ADP sensing/probing (OTG protocol) and USB charger detection.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ulpi.
QLCNIC_SRIOV;This configuration parameter enables Single Root Input Output Virtualization support for QLE83XX Converged Ethernet devices. This allows for virtual function acceleration in virtualized environments.
PAGE_POISONING_ZERO;Instead of using the existing poison value, fill the pages with zeros. This makes it harder to detect when errors are occurring due to sanitization but the zeroing at free means that it is no longer necessary to write zeros when GFP_ZERO is used on allocation.  If unsure, say N
COH901318;Enable support for ST-Ericsson COH 901 318 DMA.
SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS;Set this to the number of serial ports you want the driver to support.  This includes any ports discovered via ACPI or PCI enumeration and any ports that may be added at run-time via hot-plug, or any ISA multi-port serial cards.

The support for this governor depends on CPU capability to do fast frequency switching (i.e, very low latency frequency transitions).   To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called cpufreq_ondemand.  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpu-freq.  If in doubt, say N.
IP6_NF_TARGET_REJECT;The REJECT target allows a filtering rule to specify that an ICMPv6 error should be issued in response to an incoming packet, rather than silently being dropped.  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
DVB_ISL6405;An SEC control chip.
XEN_SYS_HYPERVISOR;Create entries under /sys/hypervisor describing the Xen hypervisor environment.  When running native or in another virtual environment, /sys/hypervisor will still be present, but will have no xen contents.

MAC80211_MESH_CSA_DEBUG;Selecting this option causes mac80211 to print out very verbose mesh channel switch debugging messages (when mac80211 is taking part in a mesh network).  Do not select this option.
DEBUG_STACK_USAGE;Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each task has ever had available in the sysrq-T and sysrq-P debug output.  This option will slow down process creation somewhat.
SND_YMFPCI;Say Y here to include support for Yamaha PCI audio chips - YMF724, YMF724F, YMF740, YMF740C, YMF744, YMF754.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called snd-ymfpci.
BOOTPARAM_SOFTLOCKUP_PANIC;Say Y here to enable the kernel to panic on soft lockups, which are bugs that cause the kernel to loop in kernel mode for more than 20 seconds (configurable using the watchdog_thresh sysctl), without giving other tasks a chance to run.  The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout, to cause the system to reboot automatically after a lockup has been detected. This feature is useful for high-availability systems that have uptime guarantees and where a lockup must be resolved ASAP.  Say N if unsure.
VIDEO_STM32_HDMI_CEC;This is a driver for STM32 interface. It uses the generic CEC framework interface. CEC bus is present in the HDMI connector and enables communication between compatible devices.
BOARD_TPCI200;This driver adds support for the TEWS TPCI200 IndustryPack carrier board.

PPS;PPS (Pulse Per Second) is a special pulse provided by some GPS antennae. Userland can use it to get a high-precision time reference.  Some antennae's PPS signals are connected with the CD (Carrier Detect) pin of the serial line they use to communicate with the host. In this case use the SERIAL_LINE client support.  Some antennae's PPS signals are connected with some special host inputs so you have to enable the corresponding client support.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called pps_core.ko.

HAVE_MIXED_BREAKPOINTS_REGS;Depending on the arch implementation of hardware breakpoints, some of them have separate registers for data and instruction breakpoints addresses, others have mixed registers to store them but define the access type in a control register. Select this option if your arch implements breakpoints under the latter fashion.
IA32_AOUT;Support old a.out binaries in the 32bit emulation.
GLOB;This option provides a glob_match function for performing simple text pattern matching.  It originated in the ATA code to blacklist particular drive models, but other device drivers may need similar functionality.  All drivers in the Linux kernel tree that require this function should automatically select this option.  Say N unless you are compiling an out-of tree driver which tells you that it depends on this.

ISCSI_TCP;The iSCSI Driver provides a host with the ability to access storage through an IP network. The driver uses the iSCSI protocol to transport SCSI requests and responses over a TCP/IP network between the host (the initiator) and targets.  Architecturally, the iSCSI driver combines with the host's TCP/IP stack, network drivers, and Network Interface Card (NIC) to provide the same functions as a SCSI or a Fibre Channel (FC) adapter driver with a Host Bus Adapter (HBA).  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called iscsi_tcp.

The GPMI supports several NAND flashs at the same time. The GPMI may conflicts with other block, such as SD card. So pay attention to it when you enable the GPMI.
AIC79XX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE;Specify the number of commands you would like to allocate per SCSI device when Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is enabled on that device.  This is an upper bound value for the number of tagged transactions to be used for any device.  The aic7xxx driver will automatically vary this number based on device behavior.  For devices with a fixed maximum, the driver will eventually lock to this maximum and display a console message indicating this value.  Due to resource allocation issues in the Linux SCSI mid-layer, using a high number of commands per device may result in memory allocation failures when many devices are attached to the system.  For this reason, the default is set to 32.  Higher values may result in higher performance on some devices.  The upper bound is 253.  0 disables tagged queueing.  Per device tag depth can be controlled via the kernel command line tag_info option.  See Documentation/scsi/aic79xx.txt for details.

TYPEC_UCSI;USB Type-C Connector System Software Interface (UCSI) is a specification for an interface that allows the operating system to control the USB Type-C ports. On UCSI system the USB Type-C ports function autonomously by default, but in order to get the status of the ports and support basic operations like role swapping, the driver is required. UCSI is available on most of the new Intel based systems that are equipped with Embedded Controller and USB Type-C ports.  UCSI specification does not define the interface method, so depending on the platform, ACPI, PCI, I2C, etc. may be used. Therefore this driver only provides the core part, and separate drivers are needed for every supported interface method.  The UCSI specification can be downloaded from: http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/io/universal-serial-bus/usb-type-c-ucsi-spec.html  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called typec_ucsi.

CFAG12864B_RATE;Refresh rate of the LCD.  As the LCD is not memory mapped, the driver has to make the work by software. This means you should be careful setting this value higher. If your CPUs are really slow or you feel the system is slowed down, decrease the value.  Be careful modifying this value to a very high value: You can freeze the computer, or the LCD maybe can't draw as fast as you are requesting.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, ignore it.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ums-eneub6250.
AD5593R;Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD5593R Digital to Analog / Analog to Digital Converter.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ad5593r.
MTRR;On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later) the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful if you have a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance of image write operations 2.5 times or more. Saying Y here creates a /proc/mtrr file which may be used to manipulate your processor's MTRRs. Typically the X server should use this.  This code has a reasonably generic interface so that similar control registers on other processors can be easily supported as well:  The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range Registers (ARRs) which provide a similar functionality to MTRRs. For these, the ARRs are used to emulate the MTRRs. The AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above) and K6-3 processors have two MTRRs. The Centaur C6 (WinChip) has 8 MCRs, allowing write-combining. All of these processors are supported by this code and it makes sense to say Y here if you have one of them.  Saying Y here also fixes a problem with buggy SMP BIOSes which only set the MTRRs for the boot CPU and not for the secondary CPUs. This can lead to all sorts of problems, so it's good to say Y here.  You can safely say Y even if your machine doesn't have MTRRs, you'll just add about 9 KB to your kernel.  See <file:Documentation/x86/mtrr.txt> for more information.
GPIO_KEMPLD;This enables support for the PLD GPIO interface on some Kontron ETX and COMexpress (ETXexpress) modules.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called gpio-kempld.

FB_S3C;Frame buffer driver for the built-in FB controller in the Samsung SoC line from the S3C2443 onwards, including the S3C2416, S3C2450, and the S3C64XX series such as the S3C6400 and S3C6410.  These chips all have the same basic framebuffer design with the actual capabilities depending on the chip. For instance the S3C6400 and S3C6410 support 4 hardware windows whereas the S3C24XX series currently only have two.  Currently the support is only for the S3C6400 and S3C6410 SoCs.
DVB_ISL6421;An SEC control chip.
EISA;The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was developed as an open alternative to the IBM MicroChannel bus.  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and 1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.  Otherwise, say N.

PATA_PXA;This option enables support for harddrive attached to PXA CPU's bus.  NOTE: This driver utilizes PXA DMA controller, in case your hardware       is not capable of doing MWDMA, use pata_platform instead.  If unsure, say N.
APPLE_AIRPORT;Say Y here to support the Airport 802.11b wireless Ethernet hardware built into the Macintosh iBook and other recent PowerPC-based Macintosh machines. This is essentially a Lucent Orinoco card with a non-standard interface.  This driver does not support the Airport Extreme (802.11b/g). Use the BCM43xx driver for Airport Extreme cards.

GPIO_MAX732X_IRQ;Say yes here to enable the max732x to be used as an interrupt controller. It requires the driver to be built in the kernel.
SCSI_IBMVFC_TRACE;If you say Y here, the driver will trace all commands issued to the adapter. Performance impact is minimal. Trace can be dumped using /sys/class/scsi_host/hostXX/trace.
PWM_SUN4I;Generic PWM framework driver for Allwinner SoCs.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called pwm-sun4i.
GPIO_LP87565;This driver supports the GPIO on TI Lp873565 PMICs. 3 GPIOs are present on LP87565 PMICs.  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called gpio-lp87565.
DA_CONSOLE;This enables a console on a Dash channel.
FB_XILINX;Include support for the Xilinx ML300/ML403 reference design framebuffer. ML300 carries a 640*480 LCD display on the board, ML403 uses a standard DB15 VGA connector.
GREYBUS_SPI;Select this option if you have a device that follows the Greybus SPI Bridged PHY Class specification.  To compile this code as a module, chose M here: the module will be called gb-spi.ko
I2C_PASEMI;Supports the PA Semi PWRficient on-chip SMBus interfaces.
SPI_BITBANG;With a few GPIO pins, your system can bitbang the SPI protocol. Select this to get SPI support through I/O pins (GPIO, parallel port, etc).  Or, some systems' SPI master controller drivers use this code to manage the per-word or per-transfer accesses to the hardware shift registers.  This is library code, and is automatically selected by drivers that need it.  You only need to select this explicitly to support driver modules that aren't part of this kernel tree.
CRC32_SLICEBY4;Calculate checksum 4 bytes at a time with a clever slicing algorithm. This is a bit slower than slice by 8, but has a smaller 4KiB lookup table.  Only choose this option if you know what you are doing.
UBSAN;This option enables undefined behaviour sanity checker Compile-time instrumentation is used to detect various undefined behaviours in runtime. Various types of checks may be enabled via boot parameter ubsan_handle (see: Documentation/dev-tools/ubsan.rst).

OF_MDIO;OpenFirmware MDIO bus (Ethernet PHY) accessors
MEDIA_RADIO_SUPPORT;Enable AM/FM radio support.  Additional info and docs are available on the web at <https://linuxtv.org>  Say Y when you have a board with radio support.  Note: There are several TV cards that are based on chips that       support radio reception. Disabling this option will       disable support for them.
NFSD_V3_ACL;Solaris NFS servers support an auxiliary NFSv3 ACL protocol that never became an official part of the NFS version 3 protocol. This protocol extension allows applications on NFS clients to manipulate POSIX Access Control Lists on files residing on NFS servers.  NFS servers enforce POSIX ACLs on local files whether this protocol is available or not.  This option enables support in your system's NFS server for the NFSv3 ACL protocol extension allowing NFS clients to manipulate POSIX ACLs on files exported by your system's NFS server.  NFS clients which support the Solaris NFSv3 ACL protocol can then access and modify ACLs on your NFS server.  To store ACLs on your NFS server, you also need to enable ACL- related CONFIG options for your local file systems of choice.  If unsure, say N.
JUMP_LABEL;This option enables a transparent branch optimization that makes certain almost-always-true or almost-always-false branch conditions even cheaper to execute within the kernel.  Certain performance-sensitive kernel code, such as trace points, scheduler functionality, networking code and KVM have such branches and include support for this optimization technique.  If it is detected that the compiler has support for asm goto, the kernel will compile such branches with just a nop instruction. When the condition flag is toggled to true, the nop will be converted to a jump instruction to execute the conditional block of instructions.  This technique lowers overhead and stress on the branch prediction of the processor and generally makes the kernel faster. The update of the condition is slower, but those are always very rare.  ( On 32-bit x86, the necessary options added to the compiler   flags may increase the size of the kernel slightly. )
COMEDI_PARPORT;Enable support for the standard parallel port. A cheap and easy way to get a few more digital I/O lines. Steal additional parallel ports from old computers or your neighbors' computers.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called comedi_parport.
USB_CNS3XXX_EHCI;This option is deprecated now and the driver was removed, use USB_EHCI_HCD_PLATFORM instead.  Enable support for the CNS3XXX SOC's on-chip EHCI controller. It is needed for high-speed (480Mbit/sec) USB 2.0 device support.
STA2X11;This adds support for boards based on the STA2X11 IO-Hub, a.k.a. ConneXt. The chip is used in place of the standard PC chipset, so all standard peripherals are missing. If this option is selected the kernel will still be able to boot on standard PC machines.
POWER_SUPPLY;Say Y here to enable power supply class support. This allows power supply (batteries, AC, USB) monitoring by userspace via sysfs and uevent (if available) and/or APM kernel interface (if selected below).
WL18XX;This module adds support for wireless adapters based on TI WiLink 8 chipsets.
TIPC_MEDIA_IB;Saying Y here will enable support for running TIPC on IP-over-InfiniBand devices.
USB_CONFIGFS_EEM;CDC EEM is a newer USB standard that is somewhat simpler than CDC ECM and therefore can be supported by more hardware.  Technically ECM and EEM are designed for different applications.  The ECM model extends the network interface to the target (e.g. a USB cable modem), and the EEM model is for mobile devices to communicate with hosts using ethernet over USB.  For Linux gadgets, however, the interface with the host is the same (a usbX device), so the differences are minimal.
BFIN_OTP_WRITE_ENABLE;If you say Y here, you will enable support for writing of the OTP pages.  This is dangerous by nature as you can only program the pages once, so only enable this option when you actually need it so as to not inadvertently clobber data.  If unsure, say N.
CRYPTO_DRBG_MENU;NIST SP800-90A compliant DRBG. In the following submenu, one or more of the DRBG types must be selected.
CRYPTO_DEV_OMAP_AES;OMAP processors have AES module accelerator. Select this if you want to use the OMAP module for AES algorithms.

RADIO_ZOLTRIX;Choose Y here if you have one of these FM radio cards, and then fill in the port address below.  Note: this driver hasn't been tested since a long time due to lack of hardware. If you have this hardware, then please contact the linux-media mailinglist.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called radio-zoltrix.
MTD_UBI_WL_THRESHOLD;This parameter defines the maximum difference between the highest erase counter value and the lowest erase counter value of eraseblocks of UBI devices. When this threshold is exceeded, UBI starts performing wear leveling by means of moving data from eraseblock with low erase counter to eraseblocks with high erase counter.  The default value should be OK for SLC NAND flashes, NOR flashes and other flashes which have eraseblock life-cycle 100000 or more. However, in case of MLC NAND flashes which typically have eraseblock life-cycle less than 10000, the threshold should be lessened (e.g., to 128 or 256, although it does not have to be power of 2).
COMEDI_II_PCI20KC;Enable support for Intelligent Instruments PCI-20001C carrier PCI-20001, PCI-20006 and PCI-20341  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ii_pci20kc.
FB_I810_GTF;If you say Y, then the VESA standard, Generalized Timing Formula  or GTF, will be used to calculate the required video timing values per video mode.  Since the GTF allows nondiscrete timings  (nondiscrete being a range of values as opposed to discrete being a set of values), you'll be able to use any combination of horizontal  and vertical resolutions, and vertical refresh rates without having to specify your own timing parameters.  This is especially useful to maximize the performance of an aging display, or if you just  have a display with nonstandard dimensions. A VESA compliant  monitor is recommended, but can still work with non-compliant ones. If you need or want this, then select this option. The timings may  not be compliant with Intel's recommended values. Use at your own  risk.  If you say N, the driver will revert to discrete video timings  using a set recommended by Intel in their documentation.  If unsure, say N.
USB_GSPCA_PAC207;Say Y here if you want support for cameras based on the PAC207 chip.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called gspca_pac207.

SSB_PCIHOST;Support for a Sonics Silicon Backplane on top of a PCI device.  If unsure, say Y
MATH_EMULATION;Linux can emulate a math coprocessor (used for floating point operations) if you don't have one. 486DX and Pentium processors have a math coprocessor built in, 486SX and 386 do not, unless you added a 487DX or 387, respectively. (The messages during boot time can give you some hints here [man dmesg].) Everyone needs either a coprocessor or this emulation.  If you don't have a math coprocessor, you need to say Y here. if you say Y here even though you have a coprocessor, the coprocessor will be used nevertheless. (This behavior can be changed with the kernel command line option no387, which comes handy if your coprocessor is broken. Try man bootparam or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.) This means that it is a good idea to say Y here if you intend to use this kernel on different machines.  More information about the internals of the Linux math coprocessor emulation can be found in <file:arch/x86/math-emu/README>.  If you are not sure, say Y. apart from resulting in a 66 KB bigger kernel, it won't hurt.
NF_DUP_NETDEV;This option enables the generic packet duplication infrastructure for Netfilter.

For extensive information about drivers for many devices attaching to the parallel port see <http://www.torque.net/linux-pp.html> on the WWW.  It is possible to share a single parallel port among several devices and it is safe to compile all the corresponding drivers into the kernel. To compile parallel port support as a module, choose M here: the module will be called parport. If you have more than one parallel port and want to specify which port and IRQ to be used by this driver at module load time, take a look at <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  If unsure, say Y.
LTPC;This allows you to use the AppleTalk PC card to connect to LocalTalk networks. The card is also known as the Farallon PhoneNet PC card. If you are in doubt, this card is the one with the 65C02 chip on it. You also need version 1.3.3 or later of the netatalk package. This driver is experimental, which means that it may not work. See the file <file:Documentation/networking/ltpc.txt>.
BCM63XX_ENET;This driver supports the ethernet MACs in the Broadcom 63xx MIPS chipset family (BCM63XX).

Say Y here to enable support for these types of drivers.  To compile this code as a module, chose M here: the module will be called greybus.ko
TOSHIBA;This adds a driver to safely access the System Management Mode of the CPU on Toshiba portables with a genuine Toshiba BIOS. It does not work on models with a Phoenix BIOS. The System Management Mode is used to set the BIOS and power saving options on Toshiba portables.  For information on utilities to make use of this driver see the Toshiba Linux utilities web site at: <http://www.buzzard.org.uk/toshiba/>.  Say Y if you intend to run this kernel on a Toshiba portable. Say N otherwise.
MAC80211_HT_DEBUG;This option enables 802.11n High Throughput features debug tracing output.  It should not be selected on production systems as some of the messages are remotely triggerable.  Do not select this option.

SCSI_INITIO;This is support for the Initio 91XXU(W) SCSI host adapter.  Please read the SCSI-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called initio.
WIZNET_BUS_DIRECT;In direct address mode host system can directly access all registers after mapping to Memory-Mapped I/O space.
MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT;By default, a media driver auto-selects all possible ancillary devices such as tuners, sensors, video encoders/decoders and frontends, that are used by any of the supported devices.  This is generally the right thing to do, except when there are strict constraints with regards to the kernel size, like on embedded systems.  Use this option with care, as deselecting ancillary drivers which are, in fact, necessary will result in the lack of the needed functionality for your device (it may not tune or may not have the needed demodulators).  If unsure say Y.
ATM_IDT77252_RCV_ALL;Enable receiving of all cells on the ATM link, that do not match an open connection in the raw cell queue of the driver.  Useful for debugging or special applications only, so the safe answer is N.
MSM_GCC_8996;Support for the global clock controller on msm8996 devices. Say Y if you want to use peripheral devices such as UART, SPI, i2c, USB, UFS, SD/eMMC, PCIe, etc.
RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE;The RTC device that will be used to (re)initialize the system clock, usually rtc0. Initialization is done when the system starts up, and when it resumes from a low power state. This device should record time in UTC, since the kernel won't do timezone correction.  The driver for this RTC device must be loaded before late_initcall functions run, so it must usually be statically linked.  This clock should be battery-backed, so that it reads the correct time when the system boots from a power-off state. Otherwise, your system will need an external clock source (like an NTP server).  If the clock you specify here is not battery backed, it may still be useful to reinitialize system time when resuming from system sleep states. Do not specify an RTC here unless it stays powered during all this system's supported sleep states.
INPUT_RB532_BUTTON;Say Y here if you want support for the S1 button built into Mikrotik's Routerboard 532.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called rb532_button.

IRDA_FAST_RR;Say Y here is you want IrLAP to send fast RR (Receive Ready) frames when acting as a primary station. Disabling this option will make latency over IrDA very bad. Enabling this option will make the IrDA stack send more packet than strictly necessary, thus reduce your battery life (but not that much).  Fast RR will make IrLAP send out a RR frame immediately when receiving a frame if its own transmit queue is currently empty. This will give a lot of speed improvement when receiving much data since the secondary station will not have to wait the max. turn around time (usually 500ms) before it is allowed to transmit the next time. If the transmit queue of the secondary is also empty, the primary will start backing-off before sending another RR frame, waiting longer each time until the back-off reaches the max. turn around time. This back-off increase in controlled via /proc/sys/net/irda/fast_poll_increase  If unsure, say Y.
NF_CT_PROTO_SCTP;With this option enabled, the layer 3 independent connection tracking code will be able to do state tracking on SCTP connections.  If unsure, say Y.

If an attacker manages to change the contents of an important system file being measured, we can tell.  If your system has a TPM chip, then IMA also maintains an aggregate integrity value over this list inside the TPM hardware, so that the TPM can prove to a third party whether or not critical system files have been modified. Read <http://www.usenix.org/events/sec04/tech/sailer.html> to learn more about IMA. If unsure, say N.

VT;If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with display and keyboard devices. These are called virtual because you can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.  The setterm command (man setterm) can be used to change the properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The man page console_codes(4) (man console_codes) contains the special character sequences that can be used to change those properties directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with the setfont (man setfont) command and the key bindings are defined with the loadkeys (man loadkeys) command.  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some memory. the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial or network connection.

You use the modprobe tool to add (and sometimes remove) them.  If you say Y here, many parts of the kernel can be built as modules (by answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most useful for infrequently used options which are not required for booting.  For more information, see the man pages for modprobe, lsmod, modinfo, insmod and rmmod.  If you say Y here, you will need to run make modules_install to put the modules under /lib/modules/ where modprobe can find them (you may need to be root to do this).  If unsure, say Y.
FB_VIA;This is the frame buffer device driver for Graphics chips of VIA UniChrome (Pro) Family (CLE266,PM800/CN400,P4M800CE/P4M800Pro/ CN700/VN800,CX700/VX700,P4M890) and Chrome9 Family (K8M890,CN896 /P4M900,VX800) Say Y if you have a VIA UniChrome graphics board.

BINFMT_ELF;ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and executables used across different architectures and operating systems. Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC) because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able to run executables from different architectures or operating systems however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely want to say Y here.  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including ld.so (check the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and latest version).
SOUND_TRACEINIT;Verbose soundcard initialization -- affects the format of autoprobe and initialization messages at boot time.
USB_OTG_BLACKLIST_HUB;If you say Y here, then Linux will refuse to enumerate external hubs.  OTG hosts are allowed to reduce hardware and software costs by not supporting external hubs.  So are Embedded Hosts that don't offer OTG support.

That protocol is often avoided with pure Ethernet adapters, in    favor of simpler vendor-specific hardware, but is widely    supported by firmware for smart network devices.   - On hardware can't implement that protocol, a simple CDC subset    is used, placing fewer demands on USB.   - CDC Ethernet Emulation Model (EEM) is a newer standard that has    a simpler interface that can be used by more USB hardware.  RNDIS support is an additional option, more demanding than subset.  Within the USB device, this gadget driver exposes a network device usbX, where X depends on what other networking devices you have. Treat it like a two-node Ethernet link:  host, and gadget.  The Linux-USB host-side usbnet driver interoperates with this driver, so that deep I/O queues can be supported.  On 2.4 kernels, use CDCEther instead, if you're using the CDC option. That CDC mode should also interoperate with standard CDC Ethernet class drivers on other host operating systems.

This was hard-coded to KERN_WARNING since at least 2.6.10 but folks that are auditing their logs closely may want to set it to a lower priority.  Note: This does not affect what message level gets printed on the console by default. To change that, use loglevel=<x> in the kernel bootargs, or pick a different CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT configuration value.
IP_SCTP;Stream Control Transmission Protocol  From RFC 2960 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2960.txt>.

The backend driver attaches itself to a any block device specified in the XenBus configuration. There are no limits to what the block device as long as it has a major and minor.  If you are compiling a kernel to run in a Xen block backend driver domain (often this is domain 0) you should say Y here. To compile this driver as a module, chose M here: the module will be called xen-blkback.
NFC_PN544;NXP PN544 core driver. This is a driver based on the HCI NFC kernel layers and will thus not work with NXP libnfc library.
PCIE_RCAR;Say Y here if you want PCIe controller support on R-Car SoCs.
USB_GADGET_DEBUG_FILES;Some of the drivers in the gadget framework can expose debugging information in files such as /proc/driver/udc (for a peripheral controller).

BLK_DEV_NBD;Saying Y here will allow your computer to be a client for network block devices, i.e. it will be able to use block devices exported by servers (mount file systems on them etc.). Communication between client and server works over TCP/IP networking, but to the client program this is hidden: it looks like a regular local file access to a block device special file such as /dev/nd0.  Network block devices also allows you to run a block-device in userland (making server and client physically the same computer, communicating using the loopback network device).  Read <file:Documentation/blockdev/nbd.txt> for more information, especially about where to find the server code, which runs in user space and does not need special kernel support.  Note that this has nothing to do with the network file systems NFS or Coda. you can say N here even if you intend to use NFS or Coda.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called nbd.  If unsure, say N.
UFS_FS;BSD and derivate versions of Unix (such as SunOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and NeXTstep) use a file system called UFS. Some System V Unixes can create and mount hard disk partitions and diskettes using this file system as well. Saying Y here will allow you to read from these partitions. if you also want to write to them, say Y to the experimental UFS file system write support, below. Please read the file <file:Documentation/filesystems/ufs.txt> for more information.  The recently released UFS2 variant (used in FreeBSD 5.x) is READ-ONLY supported.  Note that this option is generally not needed for floppies, since a good portable way to transport files and directories between unixes (and even other operating systems) is given by the tar program (man tar or preferably info tar).  When accessing NeXTstep files, you may need to convert them from the NeXT character set to the Latin1 character set. use the program recode (info recode) for this purpose.  To compile the UFS file system support as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ufs.  If you haven't heard about all of this before, it's safe to say N.
EDAC_CELL;Support for error detection and correction on the Cell Broadband Engine internal memory controller on platform without a hypervisor
CRYPTO_DEV_TALITOS2;Say 'Y' here to use the Freescale Security Engine (SEC) version 2 and following as found on MPC83xx, MPC85xx, etc ...
PM_TRACE;This enables code to save the last PM event point across reboot. The architecture needs to support this, x86 for example does by saving things in the RTC, see below.  The architecture specific code must provide the extern functions from <linux/resume-trace.h> as well as the <asm/resume-trace.h> header with a TRACE_RESUME() macro.  The way the information is presented is architecture- dependent, x86 will print the information during a late_initcall.
NETFILTER_ADVANCED;If you say Y here you can select between all the netfilter modules. If you say N the more unusual ones will not be shown and the basic ones needed by most people will default to 'M'.  If unsure, say Y.

UBSAN_SANITIZE_ALL;This option activates instrumentation for the entire kernel. If you don't enable this option, you have to explicitly specify UBSAN_SANITIZE := y for the files/directories you want to check for UB. Enabling this option will get kernel image size increased significantly.
GPIO_ZYNQ;Say yes here to support Xilinx Zynq GPIO controller.
FB_MATROX_G;Say Y here if you have a Matrox G100, G200, G400, G450 or G550 based video card. If you select Advanced lowlevel driver options, you should check 8 bpp packed pixel, 16 bpp packed pixel, 24 bpp packed pixel and 32 bpp packed pixel. You can also use font widths different from 8.  If you need support for G400 secondary head, you must say Y to Matrox I2C support and G400 second head support right below. G450/G550 secondary head and digital output are supported without additional modules.  The driver starts in monitor mode. You must use the matroxset tool  (available at <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/>) to  swap primary and secondary head outputs, or to change output mode.   Secondary head driver always start in 640x480 resolution and you  must use fbset to change it.  Do not forget that second head supports only 16 and 32 bpp packed pixels, so it is a good idea to compile them into the kernel too. You can use only some font widths, as the driver uses generic painting procedures (the secondary head does not use acceleration engine).  G450/G550 hardware can display TV picture only from secondary CRTC, and it performs no scaling, so picture must have 525 or 625 lines.
SENSORS_ACPI_POWER;This driver exposes ACPI 4.0 power meters as hardware monitoring devices.  Say Y (or M) if you have a computer with ACPI 4.0 firmware and a power meter.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called acpi_power_meter.

USB_OHCI_HCD;The Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) is a standard for accessing USB 1.1 host controller hardware.  It does more in hardware than Intel's UHCI specification.  If your USB host controller follows the OHCI spec, say Y.  On most non-x86 systems, and on x86 hardware that's not using a USB controller from Intel or VIA, this is appropriate.  If your host controller doesn't use PCI, this is probably appropriate.  For a PCI based system where you're not sure, the lspci -v entry will list the right prog-if for your USB controller(s):  EHCI, OHCI, or UHCI.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ohci-hcd.
AGP_I460;This option gives you AGP GART support for the Intel 460GX chipset for IA64 processors.

WMI_BMOF;Say Y here if you want to be able to read a firmware-embedded WMI Binary MOF data. Using this requires userspace tools and may be rather tedious.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called wmi-bmof.
EEPROM_AT25;Enable this driver to get read/write support to most SPI EEPROMs, after you configure the board init code to know about each eeprom on your target board.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called at25.
EEPROM_AT24;Enable this driver to get read/write support to most I2C EEPROMs and compatible devices like FRAMs, SRAMs, ROMs etc. After you configure the driver to know about each chip on your target board.  Use these generic chip names, instead of vendor-specific ones like at24c64, 24lc02 or fm24c04:     24c00, 24c01, 24c02, spd (readonly 24c02), 24c04, 24c08,    24c16, 24c32, 24c64, 24c128, 24c256, 24c512, 24c1024  Unless you like data loss puzzles, always be sure that any chip you configure as a 24c32 (32 kbit) or larger is NOT really a 24c16 (16 kbit) or smaller, and vice versa. Marking the chip as read-only won't help recover from this. Also, if your chip has any software write-protect mechanism you may want to review the code to make sure this driver won't turn it on by accident.  If you use this with an SMBus adapter instead of an I2C adapter, full functionality is not available.  Only smaller devices are supported (24c16 and below, max 4 kByte).  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called at24.
GOLDFISH_BUS;This is a virtual bus to host Goldfish Android Virtual Devices.

This code can either be compiled as a module, or linked into the kernel and started at boot. If you don't understand what all this is about, say N.
IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES;Support multiple routing tables.
SPARSEMEM_MANUAL;This will be the only option for some systems, including memory hotplug systems.  This is normal.  For many other systems, this will be an alternative to Discontiguous Memory.  This option provides some potential performance benefits, along with decreased code complexity, but it is newer, and more experimental.  If unsure, choose Discontiguous Memory or Flat Memory over this option.
INFINIBAND;Core support for InfiniBand (IB).  Make sure to also select any protocols you wish to use as well as drivers for your InfiniBand hardware.
QFMT_V1;This quota format was (is) used by kernels earlier than 2.4.22. If you have quota working and you don't want to convert to new quota format say Y here.
DEBUG_CREDENTIALS;Enable this to turn on some debug checking for credential management.  The additional code keeps track of the number of pointers from task_structs to any given cred struct, and checks to see that this number never exceeds the usage count of the cred struct.  Furthermore, if SELinux is enabled, this also checks that the security pointer in the cred struct is never seen to be invalid.  If unsure, say N.
X86_PCC_CPUFREQ;This driver adds support for the PCC interface.  For details, take a look at: <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/pcc-cpufreq.txt>.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called pcc-cpufreq.  If in doubt, say N.
THERM_ADT746X;This driver provides some thermostat and fan control for the iBook G4, and the ATI based aluminium PowerBooks, allowing slightly better fan behaviour by default, and some manual control.

8139_OLD_RX_RESET;The 8139too driver was recently updated to contain a more rapid reset sequence, in the face of severe receive errors.  This new RX-reset method should be adequate for all boards.  But if you experience problems, you can enable this option to restore the old RX-reset behavior.  If unsure, say N.
KALLSYMS_ALL;Normally kallsyms only contains the symbols of functions for nicer OOPS messages and backtraces (i.e., symbols from the text and inittext sections). This is sufficient for most cases. And only in very rare cases (e.g., when a debugger is used) all symbols are required (e.g., names of variables from the data sections, etc).  This option makes sure that all symbols are loaded into the kernel image (i.e., symbols from all sections) in cost of increased kernel size (depending on the kernel configuration, it may be 300KiB or something like this).  Say N unless you really need all symbols.
MPENTIUM4;Select this for Intel Pentium 4 chips.  This includes the Pentium 4, Pentium D, P4-based Celeron and Xeon, and Pentium-4 M (not Pentium M) chips.  This option enables compile flags optimized for the chip, uses the correct cache line size, and applies any applicable optimizations.  CPUIDs: F[0-6][1-A] (in /proc/cpuinfo show = cpu family : 15 )  Select this for:   Pentiums (Pentium 4, Pentium D, Celeron, Celeron D) corename:       -Willamette       -Northwood       -Mobile Pentium 4       -Mobile Pentium 4 M       -Extreme Edition (Gallatin)       -Prescott       -Prescott 2M       -Cedar Mill       -Presler       -Smithfiled   Xeons (Intel Xeon, Xeon MP, Xeon LV, Xeon MV) corename:       -Foster       -Prestonia       -Gallatin       -Nocona       -Irwindale       -Cranford       -Potomac       -Paxville       -Dempsey
X86_REROUTE_FOR_BROKEN_BOOT_IRQS;This option enables a workaround that fixes a source of spurious interrupts. This is recommended when threaded interrupt handling is used on systems where the generation of superfluous boot interrupts cannot be disabled.  Some chipsets generate a legacy INTx boot IRQ when the IRQ entry in the chipset's IO-APIC is masked (as, e.g. the RT kernel does during interrupt handling). On chipsets where this boot IRQ generation cannot be disabled, this workaround keeps the original IRQ line masked so that only the equivalent boot IRQ is delivered to the CPUs. The workaround also tells the kernel to set up the IRQ handler on the boot IRQ line. In this way only one interrupt is delivered to the kernel. Otherwise the spurious second interrupt may cause the kernel to bring down (vital) interrupt lines.  Only affects broken chipsets. Interrupt sharing may be increased on these systems.
KEYBOARD_HIL;The Human Interface Loop is a older, 8-channel USB-like controller used in several Hewlett Packard models. This driver implements support for HIL-keyboards and pointing devices (mice, tablets, touchscreens) attached to your machine, so normally you should say Y here.

This driver does not work on all machines. In particular, early CATS boards have hardware problems that will cause the machine to simply lock up if the watchdog fires.  If in doubt, leave it out - say N.
DRM_AMDGPU_SI;Choose this option if you want to enable experimental support for SI asics.  SI is already supported in radeon. Experimental support for SI in amdgpu will be disabled by default and is still provided by radeon. Use module options to override this:  radeon.si_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1
DEBUG_WQ_FORCE_RR_CPU;Workqueue used to implicitly guarantee that work items queued without explicit CPU specified are put on the local CPU.  This guarantee is no longer true and while local CPU is still preferred work items may be put on foreign CPUs.  Kernel parameter workqueue.debug_force_rr_cpu is added to force round-robin CPU selection to flush out usages which depend on the now broken guarantee.  This config option enables the debug feature by default.  When enabled, memory and cache locality will be impacted.
MTD_CMDLINE_PARTS;Allow generic configuration of the MTD partition tables via the kernel command line. Multiple flash resources are supported for hardware where different kinds of flash memory are available.  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver for your particular device. It won't happen automatically. The SA1100 map driver (CONFIG_MTD_SA1100) has an option for this, for example.  The format for the command line is as follows:  mtdparts=<mtddef>[.<mtddef] <mtddef>  := <mtd-id>:<partdef>[,<partdef>] <partdef> := <size>[@offset][<name>][ro] <mtd-id>  := unique id used in mapping driver/device <size>    := standard linux memsize OR - to denote all remaining space <name>    := (NAME)  Due to the way Linux handles the command line, no spaces are allowed in the partition definition, including mtd id's and partition names.  Examples:  1 flash resource (mtd-id sa1100), with 1 single writable partition: mtdparts=sa1100:-  Same flash, but 2 named partitions, the first one being read-only: mtdparts=sa1100:256k(ARMboot)ro,-(root)  If unsure, say 'N'.
NETFILTER_XTABLES;This is required if you intend to use any of ip_tables, ip6_tables or arp_tables.
BSD_PROCESS_ACCT;If you say Y here, a user level program will be able to instruct the kernel (via a special system call) to write process accounting information to a file: whenever a process exits, information about that process will be appended to the file by the kernel.  The information includes things such as creation time, owning user, command name, memory usage, controlling terminal etc. (the complete list is in the struct acct in <file:include/linux/acct.h>).  It is up to the user level program to do useful things with this information.  This is generally a good idea, so say Y.

One set provides the Modular Arithmetic Unit, used for SSL offload.  The other set provides the Cipher Group, which can perform encryption, decryption, hashing, checksumming, and raw copies.
NTFS_RW;This enables the partial, but safe, write support in the NTFS driver.  The only supported operation is overwriting existing files, without changing the file length.  No file or directory creation, deletion or renaming is possible.  Note only non-resident files can be written to so you may find that some very small files (<500 bytes or so) cannot be written to.  While we cannot guarantee that it will not damage any data, we have so far not received a single report where the driver would have damaged someones data so we assume it is perfectly safe to use.  Note:  While write support is safe in this version (a rewrite from scratch of the NTFS support), it should be noted that the old NTFS write support, included in Linux 2.5.10 and before (since 1997), is not safe.  This is currently useful with TopologiLinux.  TopologiLinux is run on top of any DOS/Microsoft Windows system without partitioning your hard disk.  Unlike other Linux distributions TopologiLinux does not need its own partition.  For more information see <http://topologi-linux.sourceforge.net/>  It is perfectly safe to say N here.

In that case, you would say Y here. In general however, to not allow targets to disconnect is not reasonable if there is more than 1 device on a SCSI bus. The normal answer therefore is N.
USB_UAS;The USB Attached SCSI protocol is supported by some USB storage devices.  It permits higher performance by supporting multiple outstanding commands.  If you don't know whether you have a UAS device, it is safe to say 'Y' or 'M' here and the kernel will use the right driver.  If you compile this driver as a module, it will be named uas.

CIFS;This is the client VFS module for the SMB3 family of NAS protocols, as well as for earlier dialects such as SMB2.1, SMB2 and the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol.  CIFS was the successor to the original dialect, the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, the native file sharing mechanism for most early PC operating systems.  The SMB3 protocol is supported by most modern operating systems and NAS appliances (e.g. Samba, Windows 8, Windows 2012, MacOS). The older CIFS protocol was included in Windows NT4, 2000 and XP (and later) as well by Samba (which provides excellent CIFS and SMB3 server support for Linux and many other operating systems). Limited support for OS/2 and Windows ME and similar very old servers is provided as well.  The cifs module provides an advanced network file system client for mounting to SMB3 (and CIFS) compliant servers.  It includes support for DFS (hierarchical name space), secure per-user session establishment via Kerberos or NTLM or NTLMv2, safe distributed caching (oplock), optional packet signing, Unicode and other internationalization improvements.  In general, the default dialects, SMB3 and later, enable better performance, security and features, than would be possible with CIFS. Note that when mounting to Samba, due to the CIFS POSIX extensions, CIFS mounts can provide slightly better POSIX compatibility than SMB3 mounts. SMB2/SMB3 mount options are also slightly simpler (compared to CIFS) due to protocol improvements.  If you need to mount to Samba, Macs or Windows from this machine, say Y.
RADIO_ZOLTRIX_PORT;Enter the I/O port of your Zoltrix radio card.
CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG;Functions will have the stack-protector canary logic added in any of the following conditions:  - local variable's address used as part of the right hand side of an   assignment or function argument - local variable is an array (or union containing an array),   regardless of array type or length - uses register local variables  This feature requires gcc version 4.9 or above, or a distribution gcc with the feature backported (-fstack-protector-strong).  On an x86 defconfig build, this feature adds canary checks to about 20% of all kernel functions, which increases the kernel code size by about 2%.
EMAC_ROCKCHIP;Support for Rockchip RK3036/RK3066/RK3188 EMAC ethernet controllers. This selects Rockchip SoC glue layer support for the emac device driver. This driver is used for RK3036/RK3066/RK3188 EMAC ethernet controller.

This can be used to simply append one partition to another one or to combine several redundant hard disks into a RAID1/4/5 device so as to provide protection against hard disk failures. This is called Software RAID since the combining of the partitions is done by the kernel. Hardware RAID means that the combining is done by a dedicated controller. if you have such a controller, you do not need to say Y here.  More information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the Software RAID mini-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

These devices come in memory configurations from 32M - 1G.  If you have one, you probably want to enable this.  If this driver is compiled as a module you get the ability to select the size of the aperture window pointing into the devices memory. What this means is that if you have a 1G card, normally the kernel will use a 1G memory map as its view of the device.  As a module, you can select a 1M window into the memory and the driver will slide the window around the PMC551's memory.  This was particularly useful on the 2.2 kernels on PPC architectures as there was limited kernel space to deal with.

EFI_BOOTLOADER_CONTROL;This module installs a reboot hook, such that if reboot() is invoked with a string argument NNN, NNN is copied to the LoaderEntryOneShot EFI variable, to be read by the bootloader. If the string matches one of the boot labels defined in its configuration, the bootloader will boot once to that label. The LoaderEntryRebootReason EFI variable is set with the reboot reason: reboot or shutdown. The bootloader reads this reboot reason and takes particular action according to its policy.
HARDENED_USERCOPY;This option checks for obviously wrong memory regions when copying memory to/from the kernel (via copy_to_user() and copy_from_user() functions) by rejecting memory ranges that are larger than the specified heap object, span multiple separately allocated pages, are not on the process stack, or are part of the kernel text. This kills entire classes of heap overflow exploits and similar kernel memory exposures.
USB_PWC_INPUT_EVDEV;This option makes USB Philips cameras register the snapshot button as an input device to report button events.  If you are in doubt, say Y.
DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR;This is the portion of low virtual memory which should be protected from userspace allocation.  Keeping a user from writing to low pages can help reduce the impact of kernel NULL pointer bugs.  For most ia64, ppc64 and x86 users with lots of address space a value of 65536 is reasonable and should cause no problems. On arm and other archs it should not be higher than 32768. Programs which use vm86 functionality or have some need to map this low address space will need CAP_SYS_RAWIO or disable this protection by setting the value to 0.  This value can be changed after boot using the /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr tunable.

The Intel support is for the IA32 family, e.g. Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium 4, Xeon etc. The AMD support is for families 0x10 and later. You will obviously need the actual microcode binary data itself which is not shipped with the Linux kernel.  The preferred method to load microcode from a detached initrd is described in Documentation/x86/early-microcode.txt. For that you need to enable CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD in order for the loader to be able to scan the initrd for microcode blobs.  In addition, you can build-in the microcode into the kernel. For that you need to enable FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL and add the vendor-supplied microcode to the CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE config option.

MTD_OTP;This enables support for reading, writing and locking so called Protection Registers present on some flash chips. A subset of them are pre-programmed at the factory with a unique set of values. The rest is user-programmable.  The user-programmable Protection Registers contain one-time programmable (OTP) bits. when programmed, register bits cannot be erased. Each Protection Register can be accessed multiple times to program individual bits, as long as the register remains unlocked.  Each Protection Register has an associated Lock Register bit. When a Lock Register bit is programmed, the associated Protection Register can only be read. it can no longer be programmed. Additionally, because the Lock Register bits themselves are OTP, when programmed, Lock Register bits cannot be erased. Therefore, when a Protection Register is locked, it cannot be unlocked.  This feature should therefore be used with extreme care. Any mistake in the programming of OTP bits will waste them.
GOOGLE_FIRMWARE;These firmware drivers are used by Google's servers.  They are only useful if you are working directly on one of their proprietary servers.  If in doubt, say N.

I2C_ISMT;If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the Intel iSMT SMBus host controller interface.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called i2c-ismt.
BTT;The Block Translation Table (BTT) provides atomic sector update semantics for persistent memory devices, so that applications that rely on sector writes not being torn (a guarantee that typical disks provide) can continue to do so. The BTT manifests itself as an alternate personality for an NVDIMM namespace, i.e. a namespace can be in raw mode (pmemX, ndblkX.Y, etc...), or 'sectored' mode, (pmemXs, ndblkX.Ys, etc...).  Select Y if unsure
FB_OMAP2_DSS_MIN_FCK_PER_PCK;This can be used to adjust the minimum FCK/PCK ratio.  With this you can make sure that DISPC FCK is at least n x PCK. Video plane scaling requires higher FCK than normally.  If this is set to 0, there's no extra constraint on the DISPC FCK. However, the FCK will at minimum be 2xPCK (if active matrix) or 3xPCK (if passive matrix).  Max FCK is 173MHz, so this doesn't work if your PCK is very high.

THINKPAD_ACPI_ALSA_SUPPORT;Enables monitoring of the built-in console audio output control (headphone and speakers), which is operated by the mute and (in some ThinkPad models) volume hotkeys.  If this option is enabled, ThinkPad-ACPI will export an ALSA card with a single read-only mixer control, which should be used for on-screen-display feedback purposes by the Desktop Environment.  Optionally, the driver will also allow software control (the ALSA mixer will be made read-write).  Please refer to the driver documentation for details.  All IBM models have both volume and mute control.  Newer Lenovo models only have mute control (the volume hotkeys are just normal keys and volume control is done through the main HDA mixer).
COMEDI_DT282X;Enable support for Data Translation DT2821 series including DT-EZ DT2821, DT2821-F-16SE, DT2821-F-8DI, DT2821-G-16SE, DT2821-G-8DI, DT2823 (dt2823), DT2824-PGH, DT2824-PGL, DT2825, DT2827, DT2828, DT21-EZ, DT23-EZ, DT24-EZ and DT24-EZ-PGL  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called dt282x.

This watchdog simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze, and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of time.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called it87_wdt.
CMA_SIZE_MBYTES;Defines the size (in MiB) of the default memory area for Contiguous Memory Allocator.  If the size of 0 is selected, CMA is disabled by default, but it can be enabled by passing cma=size[MG] to the kernel.
BLK_DEV_RZ1000;The PC-Technologies RZ1000 IDE chip is used on many common 486 and Pentium motherboards, usually along with the Neptune chipset. Unfortunately, it has a rather nasty design flaw that can cause severe data corruption under many conditions.

HIDRAW;Say Y here if you want to support HID devices (from the USB specification standpoint) that aren't strictly user interface devices, like monitor controls and Uninterruptable Power Supplies.  This module supports these devices separately using a separate event interface on /dev/hidraw.  There is also a /dev/hiddev configuration option in the USB HID configuration menu. In comparison to hiddev, this device does not process the hid events at all (no parsing, no lookups). This lets applications to work on raw hid events when they want to, and avoid using transport-specific userspace libhid/libusb libraries.  If unsure, say Y.
SCSI_STEX;This driver supports Promise SuperTrak EX series storage controllers.  Promise provides Linux RAID configuration utility for these controllers. Please visit <http://www.promise.com> to download.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called stex.

FONTS;Say Y here if you would like to use fonts other than the default your frame buffer console usually use.  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about foreign fonts.  If unsure, say N (the default choices are safe).
INTEGRITY_SIGNATURE;This option enables digital signature verification support using multiple keyrings. It defines separate keyrings for each of the different use cases - evm, ima, and modules. Different keyrings improves search performance, but also allow to lock certain keyring to prevent adding new keys.

The number and size of these regions is static, but the memory allocation is not performed until the associated device file is opened. The memory is freed once the uio device is closed.  If you don't know what to do here, say N.
IP_PNP_RARP;If you want your Linux box to mount its whole root file system (the one containing the directory /) from some other computer over the net via NFS and you want the IP address of your computer to be discovered automatically at boot time using the RARP protocol (an older protocol which is being obsoleted by BOOTP and DHCP), say Y here. Note that if you want to use RARP, a RARP server must be operating on your network. Read <file:Documentation/filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt> for details.

REGULATOR_LTC3676;This enables support for the LTC3676 8-output regulators controlled via I2C.
USB_SL811_HCD_ISO;The driver doesn't support iso_frame_desc (yet), but for some simple devices that just queue one ISO frame per URB, then ISO transfers should work using the normal urb status fields.  If unsure, say N.
MTD_DATAFLASH;This enables access to AT45xxx DataFlash chips, using SPI. Sometimes DataFlash chips are packaged inside MMC-format cards. at this writing, the MMC stack won't handle those.
MTD_XIP;This allows MTD support to work with flash memory which is also used for XIP purposes.  If you're not sure what this is all about then say N.
UBIFS_ATIME_SUPPORT;Originally UBIFS did not support atime, because it looked like a bad idea due increased flash wear. This option adds atime support and it is disabled by default to preserve the old behavior. If you enable this option, UBIFS starts updating atime, which means that file-system read operations will cause writes (inode atime updates). This may affect file-system performance and increase flash device wear, so be careful. How often atime is updated depends on the selected strategy: strictatime is the heavy, relatime is lighter, etc.  If unsure, say 'N'
MMC_SDHCI_DOVE;This selects the Secure Digital Host Controller Interface in Marvell's Dove SoC.  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.  If unsure, say N.
APM_DISPLAY_BLANK;Enable console blanking using the APM. Some laptops can use this to turn off the LCD backlight when the screen blanker of the Linux virtual console blanks the screen. Note that this is only used by the virtual console screen blanker, and won't turn off the backlight when using the X Window system. This also doesn't have anything to do with your VESA-compliant power-saving monitor. Further, this option doesn't work for all laptops -- it might not turn off your backlight at all, or it might print a lot of errors to the console, especially if you are using gpm.
CIFS_NFSD_EXPORT;Allows NFS server to export a CIFS mounted share (nfsd over cifs)
MIPS_JAZZ_SONIC;This is the driver for the onboard card of MIPS Magnum 4000, Acer PICA, Olivetti M700-10 and a few other identical OEM systems.

KEYBOARD_NSPIRE;Say Y here if you want to use the built-in keypad on TI-NSPIRE.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called nspire-keypad.
RELOCATABLE;This builds a kernel image that retains relocation information so it can be loaded someplace besides the default 1MB. The relocations tend to make the kernel binary about 10% larger, but are discarded at runtime.  One use is for the kexec on panic case where the recovery kernel must live at a different physical address than the primary kernel.  Note: If CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y, then the kernel runs from the address it has been loaded at and the compile time physical address (CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START) is used as the minimum location.
DVB_STV6110;A DVB-S silicon tuner module. Say Y when you want to support this tuner.
VIDEO_ZORAN_DC30;Support for the Pinnacle/Miro DC30(+) MJPEG capture/playback card. This also supports really old DC10 cards based on the zr36050 MJPEG codec and zr36016 VFE.

The peer delay mechansim (P2P) is not supported.  This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ptp_pch.
COMEDI_ADV_PCI1760;Enable support for Advantech PCI-1760 board.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called adv_pci1760.
DVB_TDA1004X;A DVB-T tuner module. Say Y when you want to support this frontend.  This driver needs external firmware.

Each sensor driver can format data and present to user mode using input or IIO interface.
BLK_DEV_IDETAPE;If you have an IDE tape drive using the ATAPI protocol, say Y. ATAPI is a newer protocol used by IDE tape and CD-ROM drives, similar to the SCSI protocol.  If you have an SCSI tape drive however, you can say N here.  You should also say Y if you have an OnStream DI-30 tape drive. this will not work with the SCSI protocol, until there is support for the SC-30 and SC-50 versions.  If you say Y here, the tape drive will be identified at boot time along with other IDE devices, as hdb or hdc, or something similar, and will be mapped to a character device such as ht0 (check the boot messages with dmesg).  Be sure to consult the <file:drivers/ide/ide-tape.c> and <file:Documentation/ide/ide.txt> files for usage information.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ide-tape.

It is a 16 round block cipher supporting key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.  See also: <http://www.schneier.com/twofish.html>
DRM_I915_DEBUG;Choose this option to turn on extra driver debugging that may affect performance but will catch some internal issues.  Recommended for driver developers only.  If in doubt, say N.
CMA_ALIGNMENT;DMA mapping framework by default aligns all buffers to the smallest PAGE_SIZE order which is greater than or equal to the requested buffer size. This works well for buffers up to a few hundreds kilobytes, but for larger buffers it just a memory waste. With this parameter you can specify the maximum PAGE_SIZE order for contiguous buffers. Larger buffers will be aligned only to this specified order. The order is expressed as a power of two multiplied by the PAGE_SIZE.  For example, if your system defaults to 4KiB pages, the order value of 8 means that the buffers will be aligned up to 1MiB only.  If unsure, leave the default value 8.
SC6600_CDROMBASE;Base I/O port address for the CD-ROM interface of the Audio Excel DSP 16 card.
USB_SERIAL_MOS7840;Say Y here if you want to use a MCS7840 Quad-Serial or MCS7820 Dual-Serial port device from MosChip Semiconductor.

The MCS7840 has a USB device controller connected to four (4) individual UARTs while the MCS7820 controller connects to two (2) individual UARTs.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called mos7840.  If unsure, choose N.
HISAX_GAZEL;This enables HiSax support for the Gazel cards.  See <file:Documentation/isdn/README.HiSax> on how to configure it using a different D-channel protocol, or non-standard IRQ/port settings.
SIGNED_PE_FILE_VERIFICATION;This option provides support for verifying the signature(s) on a signed PE binary.
PARIDE_ON20;This option enables support for the (obsolete) 90c20 parallel port IDE protocol from OnSpec (often marketed under the ValuStore brand name). If you chose to build PARIDE support into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you should answer M to build it as a loadable module. The module will be called on20. You must also have a high-level driver for the type of device that you want to support.
SAMSUNG_MC;Support for the Memory Controller (MC) devices found on Samsung Exynos SoCs.

If you chose to build PARIDE support into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you should answer M to build it as a loadable module. The module will be called on26. You must also have a high-level driver for the type of device that you want to support.
V4L_PLATFORM_DRIVERS;Say Y here to enable support for platform-specific V4L drivers.
INPUT_GPIO_TILT_POLLED;This driver implements support for tilt switches connected to GPIO pins that are not capable of generating interrupts.  The list of gpios to use and the mapping of their states to specific angles is done via platform data.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called gpio_tilt_polled.
INFINIBAND_IPOIB_CM;This option enables support for IPoIB connected mode.  After enabling this option, you need to switch to connected mode through /sys/class/net/ibXXX/mode to actually create connections, and then increase the interface MTU with e.g. ifconfig ib0 mtu 65520.  WARNING: Enabling connected mode will trigger some packet drops for multicast and UD mode traffic from this interface, unless you limit mtu for these destinations to 2044.
SERIAL_8250_PCI;This builds standard PCI serial support. You may be able to disable this feature if you only need legacy serial support. Saves about 9K. Note that serial ports on NetMos 9835 Multi-I/O cards are handled by the parport_serial driver, enabled with CONFIG_PARPORT_SERIAL.

More information can be found at: <http://jan-steinhoff.de/linux/synaptics-usb.html>  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called synaptics_usb.
FIREWIRE;This is the new-generation IEEE 1394 (FireWire) driver stack a.k.a. Juju, a new implementation designed for robustness and simplicity. See http://ieee1394.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Juju_Migration for information about migration from the older Linux 1394 stack to the new driver stack.  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the module will be called firewire-core.
SENSORS_SHT15;If you say yes here you get support for the Sensiron SHT10, SHT11, SHT15, SHT71, SHT75 humidity and temperature sensors.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called sht15.
PPP_FILTER;Say Y here if you want to be able to filter the packets passing over PPP interfaces.  This allows you to control which packets count as activity (i.e. which packets will reset the idle timer or bring up a demand-dialed link) and which packets are to be dropped entirely. You need to say Y here if you wish to use the pass-filter and active-filter options to pppd.  If unsure, say N.
EXTRA_FIRMWARE;This option allows firmware to be built into the kernel for the case where the user either cannot or doesn't want to provide it from userspace at runtime (for example, when the firmware in question is required for accessing the boot device, and the user doesn't want to use an initrd).  This option is a string and takes the (space-separated) names of the firmware files -- the same names that appear in MODULE_FIRMWARE() and request_firmware() in the source. These files should exist under the directory specified by the EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR option, which is by default the firmware subdirectory of the kernel source tree.  For example, you might set CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE=usb8388.bin, copy the usb8388.bin file into the firmware directory, and build the kernel. Then any request_firmware(usb8388.bin) will be satisfied internally without needing to call out to userspace.  WARNING: If you include additional firmware files into your binary kernel image that are not available under the terms of the GPL, then it may be a violation of the GPL to distribute the resulting image since it combines both GPL and non-GPL work. You should consult a lawyer of your own before distributing such an image.
MTRR_SANITIZER;Convert MTRR layout from continuous to discrete, so X drivers can add writeback entries.  Can be disabled with disable_mtrr_cleanup on the kernel command line. The largest mtrr entry size for a continuous block can be set with mtrr_chunk_size.  If unsure, say Y.
HID_ORTEK;There are certain devices which have LogicalMaximum wrong in the keyboard usage page of their report descriptor. The most prevailing ones so far are manufactured by Ortek, thus the name of the driver. Currently supported devices by this driver are     - Ortek PKB-1700    - Ortek WKB-2000    - Skycable wireless presenter
REGULATOR_RK808;Select this option to enable the power regulator of ROCKCHIP PMIC RK808 and RK818. This driver supports the control of different power rails of device through regulator interface. The device supports multiple DCDC/LDO outputs which can be controlled by i2c communication.
THINKPAD_ACPI_VIDEO;Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to provide an interface to control the various video output ports.  This feature often won't work well, depending on ThinkPad model, display state, video output devices in use, whether there is a X server running, phase of the moon, and the current mood of Schroedinger's cat.  If you can use X.org's RandR to control your ThinkPad's video output ports instead of this feature, don't think twice: do it and say N here to save memory and avoid bad interactions with X.org.  NOTE: access to this feature is limited to processes with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, to avoid local DoS issues in platforms where it interacts badly with X.org.  If you are not sure, say Y here but do try to check if you could be using X.org RandR instead.
SMC9194;This is support for the SMC9xxx based Ethernet cards. Choose this option if you have a DELL laptop with the docking station, or another SMC9192/9194 based chipset.  Say Y if you want it compiled into the kernel, and read the file <file:Documentation/networking/smc9.txt>.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will be called smc9194.
PATA_VIA;This option enables support for the VIA PATA interfaces found on the many VIA chipsets.  If unsure, say N.
HISAX_IX1MICROR2;This enables HiSax support for the ITK ix1-micro Revision 2 card.  See <file:Documentation/isdn/README.HiSax> on how to configure it using the different cards, a different D-channel protocol, or non-standard IRQ/port settings.
SENSORS_AMS_I2C;I2C variant of motion sensor, found in early 2005 PowerBooks and iBooks.
POWERNV_CPUIDLE;Select this option to enable processor idle state management through cpuidle subsystem.

OPENVSWITCH;Open vSwitch is a multilayer Ethernet switch targeted at virtualized environments.  In addition to supporting a variety of features expected in a traditional hardware switch, it enables fine-grained programmatic extension and flow-based control of the network.  This control is useful in a wide variety of applications but is particularly important in multi-server virtualization deployments, which are often characterized by highly dynamic endpoints and the need to maintain logical abstractions for multiple tenants.  The Open vSwitch datapath provides an in-kernel fast path for packet forwarding.  It is complemented by a userspace daemon, ovs-vswitchd, which is able to accept configuration from a variety of sources and translate it into packet processing rules.  See http://openvswitch.org for more information and userspace utilities.  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called openvswitch.  If unsure, say N.
PPS_GENERATOR_PARPORT;If you say yes here you get support for a PPS signal generator which utilizes STROBE pin of a parallel port to send PPS signals. It uses parport abstraction layer and hrtimers to precisely control the signal.

AD7192;Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD7190, AD7192, AD7193 or AD7195 SPI analog to digital converters (ADC). If unsure, say N (but it's safe to say Y).  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ad7192.
DRM_DP_AUX_CHARDEV;Choose this option to enable a /dev/drm_dp_auxN node that allows to read and write values to arbitrary DPCD registers on the DP aux channel.
FB_BFIN_T350MCQB;This is the framebuffer device driver for a Varitronix VL-PS-COG-T350MCQB-01 display TFT LCD This display is a QVGA 320x240 24-bit RGB display interfaced by an 8-bit wide PPI It uses PPI[0..7] PPI_FS1, PPI_FS2 and PPI_CLK.
CRYPTO_NULL;These are 'Null' algorithms, used by IPsec, which do nothing.
MFD_TC3589X;Support for the Toshiba TC35892 and variants I/O Expander.  This driver provides common support for accessing the device, additional drivers must be enabled in order to use the functionality of the device.

Microchip: pic16c54 based design on ProVideo PV951 board.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called tvaudio.
PRIMA2_TIMER;Enables support for the Prima2 timer.
EDAC_ALTERA;Support for error detection and correction on the Altera SOCs. This must be selected for SDRAM ECC. Note that the preloader must initialize the SDRAM before loading the kernel.
CGROUP_PIDS;Provides enforcement of process number limits in the scope of a cgroup. Any attempt to fork more processes than is allowed in the cgroup will fail. PIDs are fundamentally a global resource because it is fairly trivial to reach PID exhaustion before you reach even a conservative kmemcg limit. As a result, it is possible to grind a system to halt without being limited by other cgroup policies. The PIDs controller is designed to stop this from happening.  It should be noted that organisational operations (such as attaching to a cgroup hierarchy will *not* be blocked by the PIDs controller), since the PIDs limit only affects a process's ability to fork, not to attach to a cgroup.
P54_COMMON;This is common code for isl38xx/stlc45xx based modules. This module does nothing by itself - the USB/PCI/SPI front-ends also need to be enabled in order to support any devices.  These devices require softmac firmware which can be found at <http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/p54>  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called p54common.
APNE;If you have a PCMCIA NE2000 compatible adapter, say Y.  Otherwise, say N.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called apne.
SERIAL_8250_DMA;This builds DMA support that can be used with 8250/16650 compatible UART controllers that support DMA signaling.
MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_BBTWRITE;On DiskOnChip devices shipped with the INFTL filesystem (Millennium and 2000 TSOP/Alon), Linux reserves some space at the end of the device for the Bad Block Table (BBT).  If you have existing INFTL data on your device (created by non-Linux tools such as M-Systems' DOS drivers), your data might overlap the area Linux wants to use for the BBT.  If this is a concern for you, leave this option disabled and Linux will not write BBT data into this area. The downside of leaving this option disabled is that if bad blocks are detected by Linux, they will not be recorded in the BBT, which could cause future problems. Once you enable this option, new filesystems (INFTL or others, created in Linux or other operating systems) will not use the reserved area. The only reason not to enable this option is to prevent damage to preexisting filesystems. Even if you leave this disabled, you can enable BBT writes at module load time (assuming you build diskonchip as a module) with the module parameter inftl_bbt_write=1.
MFD_QCOM_RPM;If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the Resource Power Manager system found in the Qualcomm 8660, 8960 and 8064 based devices.  This is required to access many regulators, clocks and bus frequencies controlled by the RPM on these devices.  Say M here if you want to include support for the Qualcomm RPM as a module. This will build a module called qcom_rpm.

PINCTRL_IPQ4019;This is the pinctrl, pinmux, pinconf and gpiolib driver for the Qualcomm TLMM block found in the Qualcomm IPQ4019 platform.
REGULATOR_MAX8973;The MAXIM MAX8973 high-efficiency. three phase, DC-DC step-down switching regulator delievers up to 9A of output current. Each phase operates at a 2MHz fixed frequency with a 120 deg shift from the adjacent phase, allowing the use of small magnetic component.
PERF_EVENTS_INTEL_UNCORE;Include support for Intel uncore performance events. These are available on NehalemEX and more modern processors.
RT73USB;This adds support for rt2501 wireless chipset family. Supported chips: RT2571W, RT2573 & RT2671.  When compiled as a module, this driver will be called rt73usb.

REGULATOR_BCM590XX;This driver provides support for the voltage regulators on the BCM590xx PMUs. This will enable support for the software controllable LDO/Switching regulators.
USB_MTU3_HOST;Select this when you want to use MTU3 in host mode only, thereby the gadget feature will be regressed.
HMC6352;This driver provides support for the Honeywell HMC6352 compass, providing configuration and heading data via sysfs.
USB_MUSB_GADGET;Select this when you want to use MUSB in gadget mode only, thereby the host feature will be regressed.

RTL8XXXU;This is an alternative driver for various Realtek RTL8XXX parts written to utilize the Linux mac80211 stack. The driver is known to work with a number of RTL8723AU, RL8188CU, RTL8188RU, RTL8191CU, and RTL8192CU devices  This driver is under development and has a limited feature set. In particular it does not yet support 40MHz channels and power management. However it should have a smaller memory footprint than the vendor drivers and benefits from the in kernel mac80211 stack.  It can coexist with drivers from drivers/staging/rtl8723au, drivers/staging/rtl8192u, and drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi, but you will need to control which module you wish to load.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called r8xxxu.  If unsure, say N.
CHARGER_TPS65217;Say Y here to enable support for battery charging with TPS65217 PMIC chips.
HAVE_ARCH_VMAP_STACK;An arch should select this symbol if it can support kernel stacks in vmalloc space.  This means:  - vmalloc space must be large enough to hold many kernel stacks.   This may rule out many 32-bit architectures.  - Stacks in vmalloc space need to work reliably.  For example, if   vmap page tables are created on demand, either this mechanism   needs to work while the stack points to a virtual address with   unpopulated page tables or arch code (switch_to() and switch_mm(),   most likely) needs to ensure that the stack's page table entries   are populated before running on a possibly unpopulated stack.  - If the stack overflows into a guard page, something reasonable   should happen.  The definition of reasonable is flexible, but   instantly rebooting without logging anything would be unfriendly.
FSL_USB2_OTG;Enable this to support Freescale USB OTG transceiver.
VIDEO_RENESAS_VSP1;This is a V4L2 driver for the Renesas VSP1 video processing engine.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called vsp1.

IR_MCEUSB;Say Y here if you want to use a Windows Media Center Edition eHome Infrared Transceiver.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called mceusb.
INTEL_ISH_HID;The Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH) enables the ability to offload sensor polling and algorithm processing to a dedicated low power processor in the chipset. This allows the core processor to go into low power modes more often, resulting in the increased battery life. The current processors that support ISH are: Cherrytrail, Skylake, Broxton and Kaby Lake.  Say Y here if you want to support Intel ISH. If unsure, say N.
VHOST_NET;This kernel module can be loaded in host kernel to accelerate guest networking with virtio_net. Not to be confused with virtio_net module itself which needs to be loaded in guest kernel.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called vhost_net.

ACORN_PARTITION;Support hard disks partitioned under Acorn operating systems.
XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND;The PCI device backend driver allows the kernel to export arbitrary PCI devices to other guests. If you select this to be a module, you will need to make sure no other driver has bound to the device(s) you want to make visible to other guests.  The parameter passthrough allows you specify how you want the PCI devices to appear in the guest. You can choose the default (0) where PCI topology starts at 00.00.0, or (1) for passthrough if you want the PCI devices topology appear the same as in the host.  The hide parameter (only applicable if backend driver is compiled into the kernel) allows you to bind the PCI devices to this module from the default device drivers. The argument is the list of PCI BDFs: xen-pciback.hide=(03:00.0)(04:00.0)  If in doubt, say m.

If you say Y here, Linux will be able to read from ADFS partitions on hard drives and from ADFS-formatted floppy discs. If you also want to be able to write to those devices, say Y to ADFS write support below.  The ADFS partition should be the first partition (i.e., /dev/[hs]d?1) on each of your drives. Please read the file <file:Documentation/filesystems/adfs.txt> for further details.  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called adfs.  If unsure, say N.
IPV6_ROUTER_PREF;Router Preference is an optional extension to the Router Advertisement message which improves the ability of hosts to pick an appropriate router, especially when the hosts are placed in a multi-homed network.  If unsure, say N.
PROC_FS;This is a virtual file system providing information about the status of the system. Virtual means that it doesn't take up any space on your hard disk: the files are created on the fly by the kernel when you try to access them. Also, you cannot read the files with older version of the program less: you need to use more or cat.  It's totally cool. for example, cat /proc/interrupts gives information about what the different IRQs are used for at the moment (there is a small number of Interrupt ReQuest lines in your computer that are used by the attached devices to gain the CPU's attention -- often a source of trouble if two devices are mistakenly configured to use the same IRQ). The program procinfo to display some information about your system gathered from the /proc file system.  Before you can use the /proc file system, it has to be mounted, meaning it has to be given a location in the directory hierarchy. That location should be /proc. A command such as mount -t proc proc /proc or the equivalent line in /etc/fstab does the job.  The /proc file system is explained in the file <file:Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt> and on the proc(5) manpage (man 5 proc).  This option will enlarge your kernel by about 67 KB. Several programs depend on this, so everyone should say Y here.
IP_SET;This option adds IP set support to the kernel. In order to define and use the sets, you need the userspace utility ipset(8). You can use the sets in netfilter via the set match and SET target.  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
HIBERNATION;Enable the suspend to disk (STD) functionality, which is usually called hibernation in user interfaces.  STD checkpoints the system and powers it off. and restores that checkpoint on reboot.  You can suspend your machine with 'echo disk > /sys/power/state' after placing resume=/dev/swappartition on the kernel command line in your bootloader's configuration file.  Alternatively, you can use the additional userland tools available from <http://suspend.sf.net>.  In principle it does not require ACPI or APM, although for example ACPI will be used for the final steps when it is available.  One of the reasons to use software suspend is that the firmware hooks for suspend states like suspend-to-RAM (STR) often don't work very well with Linux.  It creates an image which is saved in your active swap. Upon the next boot, pass the 'resume=/dev/swappartition' argument to the kernel to have it detect the saved image, restore memory state from it, and continue to run as before. If you do not want the previous state to be reloaded, then use the 'noresume' kernel command line argument. Note, however, that fsck will be run on your filesystems and you will need to run mkswap against the swap partition used for the suspend.  It also works with swap files to a limited extent (for details see <file:Documentation/power/swsusp-and-swap-files.txt>).  Right now you may boot without resuming and resume later but in the meantime you cannot use the swap partition(s)/file(s) involved in suspending.  Also in this case you must not use the filesystems that were mounted before the suspend.  In particular, you MUST NOT MOUNT any journaled filesystems mounted before the suspend or they will get corrupted in a nasty way.  For more information take a look at <file:Documentation/power/swsusp.txt>.
KCOV;KCOV exposes kernel code coverage information in a form suitable for coverage-guided fuzzing (randomized testing).  If RANDOMIZE_BASE is enabled, PC values will not be stable across different machines and across reboots. If you need stable PC values, disable RANDOMIZE_BASE.  For more details, see Documentation/dev-tools/kcov.rst.

The tests are executed by writing to the test file in debugfs under each card. Note that whatever is on your card will be overwritten by these tests.  This driver is only of interest to those developing or testing a host driver. Most people should say N here.
MVMDIO;This driver supports the MDIO interface found in the network interface units of the Marvell EBU SoCs (Kirkwood, Orion5x, Dove, Armada 370 and Armada XP).  This driver is used by the MV643XX_ETH and MVNETA drivers.

COMMON_CLK_CDCE925;---help---   This driver supports the TI CDCE913/925/937/949 programmable clock   synthesizer. Each chip has different number of PLLs and outputs.   For example, the CDCE925 contains two PLLs with spread-spectrum   clocking support and five output dividers. The driver only supports   the following setup, and uses a fixed setting for the output muxes.   Y1 is derived from the input clock   Y2 and Y3 derive from PLL1   Y4 and Y5 derive from PLL2   Given a target output frequency, the driver will set the PLL and   divider to best approximate the desired output.
SQUASHFS_DECOMP_MULTI_PERCPU;By default Squashfs uses a single decompressor but it gives poor performance on parallel I/O workloads when using multiple CPU machines due to waiting on decompressor availability.  This decompressor implementation uses a maximum of one decompressor per core.  It uses percpu variables to ensure decompression is load-balanced across the cores.
BFIN_UART2_CTSRTS;Enable hardware flow control in the driver.
RTC_CLASS;Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will be allowed to plug one or more RTCs to your system. You will probably want to enable one or more of the interfaces below.

BLK_DEV_NVME;The NVM Express driver is for solid state drives directly connected to the PCI or PCI Express bus.  If you know you don't have one of these, it is safe to answer N.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called nvme.
SENSORS_WM8350;If you say yes here you get support for the hardware monitoring features of the WM835x series of PMICs.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called wm8350-hwmon.
NTB_IDT;This driver supports NTB of cappable IDT PCIe-switches.  Some of the pre-initializations must be made before IDT PCIe-switch exposes it NT-functions correctly. It should be done by either proper initialisation of EEPROM connected to master smbus of the switch or by BIOS using slave-SMBus interface changing corresponding registers value. Evidently it must be done before PCI bus enumeration is finished in Linux kernel.  First of all partitions must be activated and properly assigned to all the ports with NT-functions intended to be activated (see SWPARTxCTL and SWPORTxCTL registers). Then all NT-function BARs must be enabled with chosen valid aperture. For memory windows related BARs the aperture settings shall determine the maximum size of memory windows accepted by a BAR. Note that BAR0 must map PCI configuration space registers.  It's worth to note, that since a part of this driver relies on the BAR settings of peer NT-functions, the BAR setups can't be done over kernel PCI fixups. That's why the alternative pre-initialization techniques like BIOS using SMBus interface or EEPROM should be utilized. Additionally if one needs to have temperature sensor information printed to system log, the corresponding registers must be initialized within BIOS/EEPROM as well.  If unsure, say N.
MFD_KEMPLD;This is the core driver for the PLD (Programmable Logic Device) found on some Kontron ETX and COMexpress (ETXexpress) modules. The PLD device may provide functions like watchdog, GPIO, UART and I2C bus.

SERIAL_NONSTANDARD;Say Y here if you have any non-standard serial boards -- boards which aren't supported using the standard dumb serial driver. This includes intelligent serial boards such as Cyclades, Digiboards, etc. These are usually used for systems that need many serial ports because they serve many terminals or dial-in connections.  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about non-standard serial boards.  Most people can say N here.
PCMCIA_HERMES;A driver for Hermes chipset based PCMCIA wireless adaptors, such as the Lucent WavelanIEEE/Orinoco cards and their OEM (Cabletron/ EnteraSys RoamAbout 802.11, ELSA Airlancer, Melco Buffalo and others).

This is a companion Power Management IC with Flash, Haptic, Charger, and MUIC(Micro USB Interface Controller) controls on chip. This driver provides common support for accessing the device. additional drivers must be enabled in order to use the functionality of the device.
BLK_DEBUG_FS;Include block layer debugging information in debugfs. This information is mostly useful for kernel developers, but it doesn't incur any cost at runtime.  Unless you are building a kernel for a tiny system, you should say Y here.
INET_DIAG_DESTROY;Provides a SOCK_DESTROY operation that allows privileged processes (e.g., a connection manager or a network administration tool such as ss) to close sockets opened by other processes. Closing a socket in this way interrupts any blocking read/write/connect operations on the socket and causes future socket calls to behave as if the socket had been disconnected. If unsure, say N.
KEYBOARD_OMAP4;Say Y here if you want to use the OMAP4+ keypad.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called omap4-keypad.

INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_XZ;XZ uses the LZMA2 algorithm and has a large dictionary which may cause problems on memory constrained systems. The initramfs size is about 30% smaller with XZ in comparison to gzip. Decompression speed is better than that of bzip2 but worse than gzip and LZO. Compression is slow.  If you choose this, keep in mind that you may need to install the xz tool to be able to compress the initram.
DMADEVICES_DEBUG;This is an option for use by developers. most people should say N here.  This enables DMA engine core and driver debugging.
RTC_DRV_TX4939;Driver for the internal RTC (Realtime Clock) module found on Toshiba TX4939 SoC.
QCOM_SMSM;Say yes here to support the Qualcomm Shared Memory State Machine. The state machine is represented by bits in shared memory.
NET_VENDOR_QLOGIC;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about QLogic cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
INTEL_IOMMU_FLOPPY_WA;Floppy disk drivers are known to bypass DMA API calls thereby failing to work when IOMMU is enabled. This workaround will setup a 1:1 mapping for the first 16MiB to make floppy (an ISA device) work.
SPI_INTEL_SPI_PLATFORM;This enables platform support for the Intel PCH/PCU SPI controller in master mode. This controller is present in modern Intel hardware and is used to hold BIOS and other persistent settings. Using this driver it is possible to upgrade BIOS directly from Linux.  Say N here unless you know what you are doing. Overwriting the SPI flash may render the system unbootable.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called intel-spi-platform.
INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_LZ4;It's compression ratio is the poorest amongst the choices. The kernel size is about 15% bigger than gzip. however its decompression speed is the fastest.  If you choose this, keep in mind that most distros don't provide lz4 by default which could cause a build failure.
DEBUG_PREEMPT;If you say Y here then the kernel will use a debug variant of the commonly used smp_processor_id() function and will print warnings if kernel code uses it in a preemption-unsafe way. Also, the kernel will detect preemption count underflows.
IOMMU_STRESS;This option disables various optimizations in IOMMU related code to do real stress testing of the IOMMU code. This option will cause a performance drop and should only be enabled for testing.
SENSORS_ADS1015;If you say yes here you get support for Texas Instruments ADS1015/ADS1115 12/16-bit 4-input ADC device.  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called ads1015.
X86_LONGRUN;This adds the CPUFreq driver for Transmeta Crusoe and Efficeon processors which support LongRun.  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.  If in doubt, say N.
PRINTK_TIME;Selecting this option causes time stamps of the printk() messages to be added to the output of the syslog() system call and at the console.  The timestamp is always recorded internally, and exported to /dev/kmsg. This flag just specifies if the timestamp should be included, not that the timestamp is recorded.  The behavior is also controlled by the kernel command line parameter printk.time=1. See Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.rst
PGTABLE_MAPPING;By default, zsmalloc uses a copy-based object mapping method to access allocations that span two pages. However, if a particular architecture (ex, ARM) performs VM mapping faster than copying, then you should select this. This causes zsmalloc to use page table mapping rather than copying for object mapping.  You can check speed with zsmalloc benchmark: https://github.com/spartacus06/zsmapbench
KASAN_OUTLINE;Before every memory access compiler insert function call __asan_load*/__asan_store*. These functions performs check of shadow memory. This is slower than inline instrumentation, however it doesn't bloat size of kernel's .text section so much as inline does.
SQUASHFS;Saying Y here includes support for SquashFS 4.0 (a Compressed Read-Only File System).  Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses zlib, lzo or xz compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 1 Mbytes (default block size 128K).

Current implementation in the optimal configuration have in average 30,000 different possible virtual addresses for each memory section.  If unsure, say Y.
DEBUG_TLBFLUSH;X86-only for now.  This option allows the user to tune the amount of TLB entries the kernel flushes one-by-one instead of doing a full TLB flush. In certain situations, the former is cheaper. This is controlled by the tlb_flushall_shift knob under /sys/kernel/debug/x86. If you set it to -1, the code flushes the whole TLB unconditionally. Otherwise, for positive values of it, the kernel will use single TLB entry invalidating instructions according to the following formula:  flush_entries <= active_tlb_entries / 2^tlb_flushall_shift  If in doubt, say N.

You usually use those boards to connect your computer to an amateur radio modem (such as the WA4DSY 56kbps modem), in order to send and receive AX.25 packet radio network traffic.  Currently, this driver supports Ottawa PI/PI2, Paccomm/Gracilis PackeTwin, and S5SCC/DMA boards. They are detected automatically. If you have one of these cards, say Y here and read the AX25-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  This driver can operate multiple boards simultaneously. If you compile it as a module (by saying M instead of Y), it will be called dmascc. If you don't pass any parameter to the driver, all possible I/O addresses are probed. This could irritate other devices that are currently not in use. You may specify the list of addresses to be probed by dmascc.io=addr1,addr2,... (when compiled into the kernel image) or io=addr1,addr2,... (when loaded as a module). The network interfaces will be called dmascc0 and dmascc1 for the board detected first, dmascc2 and dmascc3 for the second one, and so on.  Before you configure each interface with ifconfig, you MUST set certain parameters, such as channel access timing, clock mode, and DMA channel. This is accomplished with a small utility program, dmascc_cfg, available at <http://www.linux-ax25.org/wiki/Ax25-tools>.

USB_GADGET;USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices. The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up: you can't connect a to-the-host connector to a peripheral.  Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon, or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more familiar host side controllers have names like EHCI, OHCI, or UHCI, and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC motherboards.  Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your peripheral/device side bus controller, and a gadget driver for your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers, you may configure more than one.)  If in doubt, say N and don't enable these drivers. most people don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).  For more information, see <http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget> and the kernel documentation for this API.

REGULATOR_LTC3589;This enables support for the LTC3589, LTC3589-1, and LTC3589-2 8-output regulators controlled via I2C.
SERIAL_PCH_UART;This driver is for PCH(Platform controller Hub) UART of Intel EG20T which is an IOH(Input/Output Hub) for x86 embedded processor. Enabling PCH_DMA, this PCH UART works as DMA mode.  This driver also can be used for LAPIS Semiconductor IOH(Input/ Output Hub), ML7213, ML7223 and ML7831. ML7213 IOH is for IVI(In-Vehicle Infotainment) use, ML7223 IOH is for MP(Media Phone) use and ML7831 IOH is for general purpose use. ML7213/ML7223/ML7831 is companion chip for Intel Atom E6xx series. ML7213/ML7223/ML7831 is completely compatible for Intel EG20T PCH.
ROCKCHIP_ANALOGIX_DP;This selects support for Rockchip SoC specific extensions for the Analogix Core DP driver. If you want to enable DP on RK3288 based SoC, you should selet this option.

FB_OMAP2_DEBUG_SUPPORT;Support for debug output. You have to enable the actual printing with 'debug' module parameter.
SLAB_MERGE_DEFAULT;For reduced kernel memory fragmentation, slab caches can be merged when they share the same size and other characteristics. This carries a risk of kernel heap overflows being able to overwrite objects from merged caches (and more easily control cache layout), which makes such heap attacks easier to exploit by attackers. By keeping caches unmerged, these kinds of exploits can usually only damage objects in the same cache. To disable merging at runtime, slab_nomerge can be passed on the kernel command line.
DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP;Enable some debugging help. Currently it exports additional stat files in a cgroup which can be useful for debugging.
DRM_EXYNOS_DPI;This enables support for Exynos parallel output.
SPI_SLAVE;If your system has a slave-capable SPI controller, you can enable slave protocol handlers.
NET_IPIP;Tunneling means encapsulating data of one protocol type within another protocol and sending it over a channel that understands the encapsulating protocol. This particular tunneling driver implements encapsulation of IP within IP, which sounds kind of pointless, but can be useful if you want to make your (or some other) machine appear on a different network than it physically is, or to use mobile-IP facilities (allowing laptops to seamlessly move between networks without changing their IP addresses).  Saying Y to this option will produce two modules ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want). Most people won't need this and can say N.

Via usb-storage, you may be able to drive the USB-x0 and DI-x0 drives as well. Note that there is also a second generation of OnStream tape drives (ADR-x0) that supports the standard SCSI-2 commands for tapes (QIC-157) and can be driven by the standard driver st. For more information, you may have a look at the SCSI-HOWTO <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>  and <file:Documentation/scsi/osst.txt>  in the kernel source. More info on the OnStream driver may be found on <http://sourceforge.net/projects/osst/> Please also have a look at the standard st docu, as most of it applies to osst as well.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read <file:Documentation/scsi/scsi.txt>. The module will be called osst.
SLUB_DEBUG_ON;Boot with debugging on by default. SLUB boots by default with the runtime debug capabilities switched off. Enabling this is equivalent to specifying the slub_debug parameter on boot. There is no support for more fine grained debug control like possible with slub_debug=xxx. SLUB debugging may be switched off in a kernel built with CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON by specifying slub_debug=-.
SECURITY_SMACK_BRINGUP;Enable the bring-up (b) access mode in Smack rules. When access is granted by a rule with the b mode a message about the access requested is generated. The intention is that a process can be granted a wide set of access initially with the bringup mode set on the rules. The developer can use the information to identify which rules are necessary and what accesses may be inappropriate. The developer can reduce the access rule set once the behavior is well understood. This is a superior mechanism to the oft abused permissive mode of other systems. If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.
VIDEO_VIVID_CEC;When selected the vivid module will emulate the optional HDMI CEC feature.
SERIAL_LANTIQ;Support for console and UART on Lantiq SoCs.

DVB_DRXD;A DVB-T tuner module. Say Y when you want to support this frontend.  Note: this driver was based on vendor driver reference code (released under the GPL) as opposed to the existing drx397xd driver, which was written via reverse engineering.
COMEDI_DEFAULT_BUF_MAXSIZE_KB;This is the default maximum asynchronous buffer size which can be requested by a userspace program without root privileges. This is set to 20480 KiB so that a fast I/O card with 16 channels running at 100 kHz has 2-4 seconds of buffer.
USB_GADGET_DEBUG;Many controller and gadget drivers will print some debugging messages if you use this option to ask for those messages.  Avoid enabling these messages, even if you're actively debugging such a driver.  Many drivers will emit so many messages that the driver timings are affected, which will either create new failure modes or remove the one you're trying to track down.  Never enable these messages for a production build.

SND_PXA2XX_SOC_E740;Say Y if you want to add support for SoC audio on the toshiba e740 PDA
AX25;This is the protocol used for computer communication over amateur radio. It is either used by itself for point-to-point links, or to carry other protocols such as tcp/ip. To use it, you need a device that connects your Linux box to your amateur radio. You can either use a low speed TNC (a Terminal Node Controller acts as a kind of modem connecting your computer's serial port to your radio's microphone input and speaker output) supporting the KISS protocol or one of the various SCC cards that are supported by the generic Z8530 or the DMA SCC driver. Another option are the Baycom modem serial and parallel port hacks or the sound card modem (supported by their own drivers). If you say Y here, you also have to say Y to one of those drivers.  Information about where to get supporting software for Linux amateur radio as well as information about how to configure an AX.25 port is contained in the AX25-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

DEBUG_KMEMLEAK;Say Y here if you want to enable the memory leak detector. The memory allocation/freeing is traced in a way similar to the Boehm's conservative garbage collector, the difference being that the orphan objects are not freed but only shown in /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak. Enabling this feature will introduce an overhead to memory allocations. See Documentation/dev-tools/kmemleak.rst for more details.  Enabling DEBUG_SLAB or SLUB_DEBUG may increase the chances of finding leaks due to the slab objects poisoning.  In order to access the kmemleak file, debugfs needs to be mounted (usually at /sys/kernel/debug).

EFI_PCDP;If your firmware supplies the PCDP table, and you want to automatically use the primary console device it describes as the Linux console, say Y here.  If your firmware supplies the HCDP table, and you want to use the first serial port it describes as the Linux console, say Y here.  If your EFI ConOut path contains only a UART device, it will become the console automatically.  Otherwise, you must specify the console=hcdp kernel boot argument.  Neither the PCDP nor the HCDP affects naming of serial devices, so a serial console may be /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, etc, depending on how the driver discovers devices.  You must also enable the appropriate drivers (serial, VGA, etc.)  See DIG64_HCDPv20_042804.pdf available from <http://www.dig64.org/specifications/>
NLS_CODEPAGE_737;The Microsoft FAT file system family can deal with filenames in native language character sets. These character sets are stored in so-called DOS codepages. You need to include the appropriate codepage if you want to be able to read/write these filenames on DOS/Windows partitions correctly. This does apply to the filenames only, not to the file contents. You can include several codepages. say Y here if you want to include the DOS codepage that is used for Greek. If unsure, say N.

CAN_PEAK_PCIEFD;This driver adds support for the PEAK-System PCI Express FD CAN-FD cards family. These 1x or 2x CAN-FD channels cards offer CAN 2.0 a/b as well as CAN-FD access to the CAN bus. Besides the nominal bitrate of up to 1 Mbit/s, the data bytes of CAN-FD frames can be transmitted with up to 12 Mbit/s. A galvanic isolation of the CAN ports protects the electronics of the card and the respective computer against disturbances of up to 500 Volts. The PCAN-PCI Express FD can be operated with ambient temperatures in a range of -40 to +85 °C.
FSL_RAID;Enable support for Freescale RAID Engine. RAID Engine is available on some QorIQ SoCs (like P5020/P5040). It has the capability to offload memcpy, xor and pq computation for raid5/6.

VT_HW_CONSOLE_BINDING;The virtual terminal is the device that interacts with the physical terminal through console drivers. On these systems, at least one console driver is loaded. In other configurations, additional console drivers may be enabled, such as the framebuffer console. If more than 1 console driver is enabled, setting this to 'y' will allow you to select the console driver that will serve as the backend for the virtual terminals.  See <file:Documentation/console/console.txt> for more information. For framebuffer console users, please refer to <file:Documentation/fb/fbcon.txt>.

SCSI_LOGGING;This turns on a logging facility that can be used to debug a number of SCSI related problems.  If you say Y here, no logging output will appear by default, but you can enable logging by saying Y to /proc file system support and Sysctl support below and executing the command  echo <bitmask> > /proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level  where <bitmask> is a four byte value representing the logging type and logging level for each type of logging selected.  There are a number of logging types and you can find them in the source at <file:drivers/scsi/scsi_logging.h>. The logging levels are also described in that file and they determine the verbosity of the logging for each logging type.  If you say N here, it may be harder to track down some types of SCSI problems. If you say Y here your kernel will be somewhat larger, but there should be no noticeable performance impact as long as you have logging turned off.

Doing so takes away freedom from gcc to do what it thinks is best, which is desirable for the gcc 3.x series of compilers. The gcc 4.x series have a rewritten inlining algorithm and enabling this option will generate a smaller kernel there. Hopefully this algorithm is so good that allowing gcc 4.x and above to make the decision will become the default in the future. Until then this option is there to test gcc for this.  If unsure, say N.
DRM_ARCPGU;Choose this option if you have an ARC PGU controller.  If M is selected the module will be called arcpgu.

TRACER_SNAPSHOT_PER_CPU_SWAP;Allow doing a snapshot of a single CPU buffer instead of a full swap (all buffers). If this is set, then the following is allowed:      echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/per_cpu/cpu2/snapshot  After which, only the tracing buffer for CPU 2 was swapped with the main tracing buffer, and the other CPU buffers remain the same.  When this is enabled, this adds a little more overhead to the trace recording, as it needs to add some checks to synchronize recording with swaps. But this does not affect the performance of the overall system. This is enabled by default when the preempt or irq latency tracers are enabled, as those need to swap as well and already adds the overhead (plus a lot more).
NET_SCH_MULTIQ;Say Y here if you want to use an n-band queue packet scheduler to support devices that have multiple hardware transmit queues.  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sch_multiq.

MSDOS_FS;This allows you to mount MSDOS partitions of your hard drive (unless they are compressed. to access compressed MSDOS partitions under Linux, you can either use the DOS emulator DOSEMU, described in the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, or try dmsdosfs in <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/>. If you intend to use dosemu with a non-compressed MSDOS partition, say Y here) and MSDOS floppies. This means that file access becomes transparent, i.e. the MSDOS files look and behave just like all other Unix files.  If you have Windows 95 or Windows NT installed on your MSDOS partitions, you should use the VFAT file system (say Y to VFAT fs support below), or you will not be able to see the long filenames generated by Windows 95 / Windows NT.  This option will enlarge your kernel by about 7 KB. If unsure, answer Y. This will only work if you said Y to DOS FAT fs support as well. To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called msdos.

NET_VENDOR_NVIDIA;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about NVIDIA cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
MEMSTICK_UNSAFE_RESUME;If you say Y here, the MemoryStick layer will assume that all cards stayed in their respective slots during the suspend. The normal behaviour is to remove them at suspend and redetecting them at resume. Breaking this assumption will in most cases result in data corruption.  This option is usually just for embedded systems which use a MemoryStick card for rootfs. Most people should say N here.
SND_PCM_TIMER;If you disable this option, pcm timer will be unavailable, so those stubs that use pcm timer (e.g. dmix, dsnoop & co) may work incorrectlly.  For some embedded devices, we may disable it to reduce memory footprint, about 20KB on x86_64 platform.

It then creates a producer and consumer that will run for 10 seconds and sleep for 10 seconds. Each interval it will print out the number of events it recorded and give a rough estimate of how long each iteration took.  It does not disable interrupts or raise its priority, so it may be affected by processes that are running.  If unsure, say N.
NUMA;Enable NUMA (Non Uniform Memory Access) support.  The kernel will try to allocate memory used by a CPU on the local memory controller of the CPU and add some more NUMA awareness to the kernel.  For 64-bit this is recommended if the system is Intel Core i7 (or later), AMD Opteron, or EM64T NUMA.  For 32-bit this is only needed if you boot a 32-bit kernel on a 64-bit NUMA platform.  Otherwise, you should say N.

You will also very likely need the Wireless Tools in order to configure your card:  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.  It is recommended that you compile this driver as a module (M) rather than built-in (Y). This driver requires firmware at device initialization time, and when built-in this typically happens before the filesystem is accessible (hence firmware will be unavailable and initialization will fail). If you do choose to build this driver into your kernel image, you can avoid this problem by including the firmware and a firmware loader in an initramfs.

IP_VS_TAB_BITS;The IPVS connection hash table uses the chaining scheme to handle hash collisions. Using a big IPVS connection hash table will greatly reduce conflicts when there are hundreds of thousands of connections in the hash table.  Note the table size must be power of 2. The table size will be the value of 2 to the your input number power. The number to choose is from 8 to 20, the default number is 12, which means the table size is 4096. Don't input the number too small, otherwise you will lose performance on it. You can adapt the table size yourself, according to your virtual server application. It is good to set the table size not far less than the number of connections per second multiplying average lasting time of connection in the table.  For example, your virtual server gets 200 connections per second, the connection lasts for 200 seconds in average in the connection table, the table size should be not far less than 200x200, it is good to set the table size 32768 (2**15).  Another note that each connection occupies 128 bytes effectively and each hash entry uses 8 bytes, so you can estimate how much memory is needed for your box.  You can overwrite this number setting conn_tab_bits module parameter or by appending ip_vs.conn_tab_bits=? to the kernel command line if IP VS was compiled built-in.
COMMON_CLK_MT2701_HIFSYS;This driver supports Mediatek MT2701 hifsys clocks.

(This gives better performance with small packets and at high speeds).  The USB host runs usbnet, and the other end of the link might be:  - Another USB host, when using USB network or data transfer   cables.  These are often used to network laptops to PCs, like   Laplink parallel cables or some motherboards.  These rely   on specialized chips from many suppliers.  - An intelligent USB gadget, perhaps embedding a Linux system.   These include PDAs running Linux (iPaq, Yopy, Zaurus, and   others), and devices that interoperate using the standard   CDC-Ethernet specification (including many cable modems).  - Network adapter hardware (like those for 10/100 Ethernet) which   uses this driver framework.  The link will appear with a name like usb0, when the link is a two-node link, or eth0 for most CDC-Ethernet devices.  Those two-node links are most easily managed with Ethernet Bridging (CONFIG_BRIDGE) instead of routing.  For more information see <http://www.linux-usb.org/usbnet/>.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called usbnet.
MAC80211_MPATH_DEBUG;Selecting this option causes mac80211 to print out very verbose mesh path selection debugging messages (when mac80211 is taking part in a mesh network). It should not be selected on production systems as those messages are remotely triggerable.  Do not select this option.

AVS is also called SmartReflex on OMAP devices.  Say Y here to enable Adaptive Voltage Scaling class support.
ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP;Modern versions of GCC (since 4.4) have builtin functions for handling byte-swapping. Using these, instead of the old inline assembler that the architecture code provides in the __arch_bswapXX() macros, allows the compiler to see what's happening and offers more opportunity for optimisation. In particular, the compiler will be able to combine the byteswap with a nearby load or store and use load-and-swap or store-and-swap instructions if the architecture has them. It should almost *never* result in code which is worse than the hand-coded assembler in <asm/swab.h>.  But just in case it does, the use of the builtins is optional.  Any architecture with load-and-swap or store-and-swap instructions should set this. And it shouldn't hurt to set it on architectures that don't have such instructions.

The behavior can be overridden with the commandline parameter: devtmpfs.mount=0|1. This option does not affect initramfs based booting, here the devtmpfs filesystem always needs to be mounted manually after the rootfs is mounted. With this option enabled, it allows to bring up a system in rescue mode with init=/bin/sh, even when the /dev directory on the rootfs is completely empty.
BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY;Adds code that examines all block write requests (including writes of the super block). The goal is to verify that the state of the filesystem on disk is always consistent, i.e., after a power-loss or kernel panic event the filesystem is in a consistent state.  If the integrity check tool is included and activated in the mount options, plenty of kernel memory is used, and plenty of additional CPU cycles are spent. Enabling this functionality is not intended for normal use.  In most cases, unless you are a btrfs developer who needs to verify the integrity of (super)-block write requests during the run of a regression test, say N

NTFS_DEBUG;If you are experiencing any problems with the NTFS file system, say Y here.  This will result in additional consistency checks to be performed by the driver as well as additional debugging messages to be written to the system log.  Note that debugging messages are disabled by default.  To enable them, supply the option debug_msgs=1 at the kernel command line when booting the kernel or as an option to insmod when loading the ntfs module.  Once the driver is active, you can enable debugging messages by doing (as root): echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug Replacing the 1 with 0 would disable debug messages.  If you leave debugging messages disabled, this results in little overhead, but enabling debug messages results in very significant slowdown of the system.  When reporting bugs, please try to have available a full dump of debugging messages while the misbehaviour was occurring.

MAC80211_DEBUG_COUNTERS;Selecting this option causes mac80211 to keep additional and very verbose statistics about TX and RX handler use as well as a few selected dot11 counters. These will be exposed in debugfs.  Note that some of the counters are not concurrency safe and may thus not always be accurate.  If unsure, say N.
NET_VENDOR_QUALCOMM;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about Qualcomm cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
VIRTIO_BLK_SCSI;Enable support for SCSI passthrough (e.g. the SG_IO ioctl) on virtio-blk devices.  This is only supported for the legacy virtio protocol and not enabled by default by any hypervisor. You probably want to use virtio-scsi instead.
BLK_DEV_IDECD_VERBOSE_ERRORS;Turn this on to have the driver print out the meanings of the ATAPI error codes.  This will use up additional 8kB of kernel-space memory, though.
VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK_PERSISTENT_ENABLE_BY_DEFAULT;Say Y here if the scrollback history should persist by default when switching between consoles. Otherwise, the scrollback history will be flushed each time the console is switched. This feature can also be enabled using the boot command line parameter 'vgacon.scrollback_persistent=1'.  This feature might break your tool of choice to flush the scrollback buffer, e.g. clear(1) will work fine but Debian's clear_console(1) will be broken, which might cause security issues. You can use the escape sequence \e[3J instead if this feature is activated.  Note that a buffer of VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK_SIZE is taken for each created tty device. So if you use a RAM-constrained system, say N here.
USER_NS;This allows containers, i.e. vservers, to use user namespaces to provide different user info for different servers.

PHYSICAL_ALIGN;This value puts the alignment restrictions on physical address where kernel is loaded and run from. Kernel is compiled for an address which meets above alignment restriction.  If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is set, kernel will move itself to nearest address aligned to above value and run from there.  If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is not set, kernel will ignore the run time load address and decompress itself to the address it has been compiled for and run from there. The address for which kernel is compiled already meets above alignment restrictions. Hence the end result is that kernel runs from a physical address meeting above alignment restrictions.  On 32-bit this value must be a multiple of 0x2000. On 64-bit this value must be a multiple of 0x200000.  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.
FB_OMAP2_DSS_COLLECT_IRQ_STATS;Collect DSS IRQ statistics, printable via debugfs.  The statistics can be found from <debugfs>/omapdss/dispc_irq for DISPC interrupts, and <debugfs>/omapdss/dsi_irq for DSI interrupts.
ARM_TEGRA186_CPUFREQ;This adds the CPUFreq driver support for Tegra186 SOCs.

SIGNALFD;Enable the signalfd() system call that allows to receive signals on a file descriptor.  If unsure, say Y.
TRACE_EVAL_MAP_FILE;The print fmt of the trace events will show the enum/sizeof names instead of their values. This can cause problems for user space tools that use this string to parse the raw data as user space does not know how to convert the string to its value.  To fix this, there's a special macro in the kernel that can be used to convert an enum/sizeof into its value. If this macro is used, then the print fmt strings will be converted to their values.  If something does not get converted properly, this option can be used to show what enums/sizeof the kernel tried to convert.  This option is for debugging the conversions. A file is created in the tracing directory called eval_map that will show the names matched with their values and what trace event system they belong too.  Normally, the mapping of the strings to values will be freed after boot up or module load. With this option, they will not be freed, as they are needed for the eval_map file. Enabling this option will increase the memory footprint of the running kernel.  If unsure, say N

USB_EHCI_TT_NEWSCHED;This changes the periodic scheduling code to fill more of the low and full speed bandwidth available from the Transaction Translator (TT) in USB 2.0 hubs.  Without this, only one transfer will be issued in each microframe, significantly reducing the number of periodic low/fullspeed transfers possible.  If you have multiple periodic low/fullspeed devices connected to a highspeed USB hub which is connected to a highspeed USB Host Controller, and some of those devices will not work correctly (possibly due to ENOSPC or -28 errors), say Y.  Conversely, if you have only one such device and it doesn't work, you could try saying N.  If unsure, say Y.

SYSV_FS;SCO, Xenix and Coherent are commercial Unix systems for Intel machines, and Version 7 was used on the DEC PDP-11. Saying Y here would allow you to read from their floppies and hard disk partitions.  If you have floppies or hard disk partitions like that, it is likely that they contain binaries from those other Unix systems. in order to run these binaries, you will want to install linux-abi which is a set of kernel modules that lets you run SCO, Xenix, Wyse, UnixWare, Dell Unix and System V programs under Linux.  It is available via FTP (user: ftp) from <ftp://ftp.openlinux.org/pub/people/hch/linux-abi/>). NOTE: that will work only for binaries from Intel-based systems. PDP ones will have to wait until somebody ports Linux to -11 .-)  If you only intend to mount files from some other Unix over the network using NFS, you don't need the System V file system support (but you need NFS file system support obviously).  Note that this option is generally not needed for floppies, since a good portable way to transport files and directories between unixes (and even other operating systems) is given by the tar program (man tar or preferably info tar).  Note also that this option has nothing whatsoever to do with the option System V IPC. Read about the System V file system in <file:Documentation/filesystems/sysv-fs.txt>. Saying Y here will enlarge your kernel by about 27 KB.  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sysv.  If you haven't heard about all of this before, it's safe to say N.

The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) provides a dynamic mechanism for tunneling Layer 2 (L2) circuits across a packet-oriented data network (e.g., over IP).  L2TP, as originally defined in RFC 2661, is a standard method for tunneling Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1661] sessions. L2TP has since been adopted for tunneling a number of other L2 protocols, including ATM, Frame Relay, HDLC and even raw ethernet frames.  If you are connecting to L2TPv3 equipment, or you want to tunnel raw ethernet frames using L2TP, say Y here. If unsure, say N.

Note that the resulting code will be HUGE and SLOW, and probably not useful unless you are debugging a particular problem.  Say N unless you are an XFS developer, or you play one on TV.
MOUSE_GPIO;This driver simulates a mouse on GPIO lines of various CPUs (and some other chips).  Say Y here if your device has buttons or a simple joystick connected directly to GPIO lines. Your board-specific setup logic must also provide a platform device and platform data saying which GPIOs are used.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called gpio_mouse.
SCSI_NCR53C8XX_MAX_TAGS;This option allows you to specify the maximum number of commands that can be queued to any device, when tagged command queuing is possible. The default value is 32. Minimum is 2, maximum is 64. Modern hard disks are able to support 64 tags and even more, but do not seem to be faster when more than 32 tags are being used.  So, the normal answer here is to go with the default value 32 unless you are using very large hard disks with large cache (>= 1 MB) that are able to take advantage of more than 32 tagged commands.  There is no safe option and the default answer is recommended.

A cpio archive should contain a filesystem archive to be used as an initramfs image.  Directories should contain a filesystem layout to be included in the initramfs image.  Files should contain entries according to the format described by the usr/gen_init_cpio program in the kernel tree.  When multiple directories and files are specified then the initramfs image will be the aggregate of all of them.  See <file:Documentation/early-userspace/README> for more details.  If you are not sure, leave it blank.

If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific device in the following questions.
ATM_ENI_TUNE_BURST;In order to obtain good throughput, the ENI NIC can transfer multiple words of data per PCI bus access cycle. Such a multi-word transfer is called a burst.  The default settings for the burst sizes are suitable for most PCI chipsets. However, in some cases, large bursts may overrun buffers in the PCI chipset and cause data corruption. In such cases, large bursts must be disabled and only (slower) small bursts can be used. The burst sizes can be set independently in the send (TX) and receive (RX) direction.  Note that enabling many different burst sizes in the same direction may increase the cost of setting up a transfer such that the resulting throughput is lower than when using only the largest available burst size.  Also, sometimes larger bursts lead to lower throughput, e.g. on an Intel 440FX board, a drop from 135 Mbps to 103 Mbps was observed when going from 8W to 16W bursts.

For write support you must also say Y to NTFS write support below.  There are also a number of user-space tools available, called ntfsprogs.  These include ntfsundelete and ntfsresize, that work without NTFS support enabled in the kernel.  This is a rewrite from scratch of Linux NTFS support and replaced the old NTFS code starting with Linux 2.5.11.  A backport to the Linux 2.4 kernel series is separately available as a patch from the project web site.  For more information see <file:Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt> and <http://www.linux-ntfs.org/>.  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ntfs.  If you are not using Windows NT, 2000, XP or 2003 in addition to Linux on your computer it is safe to say N.

CRYPTO_AES_TI;This is a generic implementation of AES that attempts to eliminate data dependent latencies as much as possible without affecting performance too much. It is intended for use by the generic CCM and GCM drivers, and other CTR or CMAC/XCBC based modes that rely solely on encryption (although decryption is supported as well, but with a more dramatic performance hit)  Instead of using 16 lookup tables of 1 KB each, (8 for encryption and 8 for decryption), this implementation only uses just two S-boxes of 256 bytes each, and attempts to eliminate data dependent latencies by prefetching the entire table into the cache at the start of each block.

INTEL_TXT;This option enables support for booting the kernel with the Trusted Boot (tboot) module. This will utilize Intel(R) Trusted Execution Technology to perform a measured launch of the kernel. If the system does not support Intel(R) TXT, this will have no effect.  Intel TXT will provide higher assurance of system configuration and initial state as well as data reset protection.  This is used to create a robust initial kernel measurement and verification, which helps to ensure that kernel security mechanisms are functioning correctly. This level of protection requires a root of trust outside of the kernel itself.  Intel TXT also helps solve real end user concerns about having confidence that their hardware is running the VMM or kernel that it was configured with, especially since they may be responsible for providing such assurances to VMs and services running on it.  See <http://www.intel.com/technology/security/> for more information about Intel(R) TXT. See <http://tboot.sourceforge.net> for more information about tboot. See Documentation/intel_txt.txt for a description of how to enable Intel TXT support in a kernel boot.  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

NETFILTER;Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets that pass through your Linux box.  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of firewall provided by this kernel support is called a packet filter, which means that it can reject individual network packets based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall, a proxy-based one, is more secure but more intrusive and more bothersome to set up. it inspects the network traffic much more closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if you say Y here.  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without globally valid IP addresses. This is called masquerading: if one of the computers on your local network wants to send something to the outside, your box can masquerade as that computer, i.e. it forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often called NAT (Network Address Translation).  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server, typically a caching proxy server.  Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables see the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter configuration).  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see <file:Documentation/Changes> under iptables for the location of these packages.

CRYPTO_AES_NI_INTEL;Use Intel AES-NI instructions for AES algorithm.  AES cipher algorithms (FIPS-197). AES uses the Rijndael algorithm.  Rijndael appears to be consistently a very good performer in both hardware and software across a wide range of computing environments regardless of its use in feedback or non-feedback modes. Its key setup time is excellent, and its key agility is good. Rijndael's very low memory requirements make it very well suited for restricted-space environments, in which it also demonstrates excellent performance. Rijndael's operations are among the easiest to defend against power and timing attacks.  The AES specifies three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits  See <http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/> for more information.  In addition to AES cipher algorithm support, the acceleration for some popular block cipher mode is supported too, including ECB, CBC, LRW, PCBC, XTS. The 64 bit version has additional acceleration for CTR.

60XX_WDT;This driver can be used with the watchdog timer found on some single board computers, namely the 6010 PII based computer. It may well work with other cards.  It reads port 0x443 to enable and re-set the watchdog timer, and reads port 0x45 to disable the watchdog.  If you have a card that behave in similar ways, you can probably make this driver work with your card as well.  You can compile this driver directly into the kernel, or use it as a module.  The module will be called sbc60xxwdt.
TS72XX_WATCHDOG;Technologic Systems TS-7200, TS-7250 and TS-7260 boards have watchdog timer implemented in a external CPLD chip. Say Y here if you want to support for the watchdog timer on TS-72XX boards.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ts72xx_wdt.

PINCTRL_BROXTON;Broxton pinctrl driver provides an interface that allows configuring of SoC pins and using them as GPIOs.
VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_NATIVE;Select this option to enable more accurate task and CPU time accounting.  This is done by reading a CPU counter on each kernel entry and exit and on transitions within the kernel between system, softirq and hardirq state, so there is a small performance impact.  In the case of s390 or IBM POWER > 5, this also enables accounting of stolen time on logically-partitioned systems.
M62332;If you say yes here you get support for the Mitsubishi M62332 (I2C 8-Bit DACs with rail-to-rail outputs).  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be called m62332.

TIMERFD;Enable the timerfd() system call that allows to receive timer events on a file descriptor.  If unsure, say Y.
OVERLAY_FS_INDEX;If this config option is enabled then overlay filesystems will use the inodes index dir to map lower inodes to upper inodes by default. In this case it is still possible to turn off index globally with the index=off module option or on a filesystem instance basis with the index=off mount option.  The inodes index feature prevents breaking of lower hardlinks on copy up.  Note, that the inodes index feature is read-only backward compatible. That is, mounting an overlay which has an index dir on a kernel that doesn't support this feature read-only, will not have any negative outcomes.  However, mounting the same overlay with an old kernel read-write and then mounting it again with a new kernel, will have unexpected results.
TRACE_ROUTER;The trace router uses the Linux tty line discipline framework to route trace data coming from a tty port (say UART for example) to the trace sink line discipline driver and to another tty port (say USB). This is part of a solution for the MIPI P1149.7, compact JTAG, standard, which is for debugging mobile devices. The PTI driver in drivers/misc/pti.c defines the majority of this MIPI solution.  You should select this driver if the target kernel is meant for a mobile device containing a modem.  Then you will need to select Trace data sink for MIPI P1149.7 cJTAG standard line discipline driver.
SND_SOC_MT8173_RT5650_RT5676;This adds ASoC driver for Mediatek MT8173 boards with the RT5650 and RT5676 codecs. Select Y if you have such device. If unsure select N.

Compatible models include:  8 bits:   pcf8574, pcf8574a, pca8574, pca8574a,           pca9670, pca9672, pca9674, pca9674a,           max7328, max7329  16 bits:  pcf8575, pcf8575c, pca8575,           pca9671, pca9673, pca9675  Your board setup code will need to declare the expanders in use, and assign numbers to the GPIOs they expose.  Those GPIOs can then be used from drivers and other kernel code, just like other GPIOs, but only accessible from task contexts.  This driver provides an in-kernel interface to those GPIOs using platform-neutral GPIO calls.
BLK_DEV_AMD74XX;This driver adds explicit support for AMD-7xx and AMD-8111 chips and also for the nVidia nForce chip.  This allows the kernel to change PIO, DMA and UDMA speeds and to configure the chip to optimum performance.

MIPS_CDMM;Driver needed for the MIPS Common Device Memory Map bus in MIPS cores. This bus is for per-CPU tightly coupled devices such as the Fast Debug Channel (FDC).  For this to work, either your bootloader needs to enable the CDMM region at an unused physical address on the boot CPU, or else your platform code needs to implement mips_cdmm_phys_base() (see asm/cdmm.h).
I2C_ALI1563;If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the SMB Host controller on Acer Labs Inc. (ALI) M1563 South Bridges.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called mcp4531.
CRYPTO_DEV_CCP_CRYPTO;Support for using the cryptographic API with the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor. This module supports offload of SHA and AES algorithms. If you choose 'M' here, this module will be called ccp_crypto.
PROC_SYSCTL;The sysctl interface provides a means of dynamically changing certain kernel parameters and variables on the fly without requiring a recompile of the kernel or reboot of the system.  The primary interface is through /proc/sys.  If you say Y here a tree of modifiable sysctl entries will be generated beneath the /proc/sys directory. They are explained in the files in <file:Documentation/sysctl/>.  Note that enabling this option will enlarge the kernel by at least 8 KB.  As it is generally a good thing, you should say Y here unless building a kernel for install/rescue disks or your system is very limited in memory.
CRYPTO_DEV_UX500_CRYP;This selects the crypto driver for the UX500_CRYP hardware. It supports AES-ECB, CBC and CTR with keys sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bit sizes.

One solution for this problem are special LILO commands for redirecting the reference to device 0x80. The other solution is to say Y to Boot off-board chipsets first support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD) unless your mother board has the chipset natively mounted. Regardless one should use the fore mentioned option and call at LILO.  This driver requires dynamic tuning of the chipset during the ide-probe at boot.

WAN;Wide Area Networks (WANs), such as X.25, Frame Relay and leased lines, are used to interconnect Local Area Networks (LANs) over vast distances with data transfer rates significantly higher than those achievable with commonly used asynchronous modem connections.  Usually, a quite expensive external device called a `WAN router' is needed to connect to a WAN. As an alternative, a relatively inexpensive WAN interface card can allow your Linux box to directly connect to a WAN.  If you have one of those cards and wish to use it under Linux, say Y here and also to the WAN driver for your card.  If unsure, say N.
PROC_VMCORE;Exports the dump image of crashed kernel in ELF format.
KASAN;Enables kernel address sanitizer - runtime memory debugger, designed to find out-of-bounds accesses and use-after-free bugs. This is strictly a debugging feature and it requires a gcc version of 4.9.2 or later. Detection of out of bounds accesses to stack or global variables requires gcc 5.0 or later. This feature consumes about 1/8 of available memory and brings about ~x3 performance slowdown. For better error detection enable CONFIG_STACKTRACE. Currently CONFIG_KASAN doesn't work with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB (the resulting kernel does not boot).
COMEDI_USBDUX;Enable support for the Incite Technology Ltd USB-DUX-D Board  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called usbdux.

Such devices are the various Logitech Touchpads (T650, T651, TK820), some mice (Zone Touch mouse), or even keyboards (Solar Keyboard).
NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_LED;This option adds a `LED' target, which allows you to blink LEDs in response to particular packets passing through your machine.  This can be used to turn a spare LED into a network activity LED, which only flashes in response to FTP transfers, for example.  Or you could have an LED which lights up for a minute or two every time somebody connects to your machine via SSH.  You will need support for the led class to make this work.  To create an LED trigger for incoming SSH traffic:   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j LED --led-trigger-id ssh --led-delay 1000  Then attach the new trigger to an LED on your system:   echo netfilter-ssh > /sys/class/leds/<ledname>/trigger  For more information on the LEDs available on your system, see Documentation/leds/leds-class.txt
MTD_NAND_PXA3xx;This enables the driver for the NAND flash device found on PXA3xx processors (NFCv1) and also on Armada 370/XP (NFCv2).

DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH;The section mismatch analysis checks if there are illegal references from one section to another section. During linktime or runtime, some sections are dropped. any use of code/data previously in these sections would most likely result in an oops. In the code, functions and variables are annotated with __init,, etc. (see the full list in include/linux/init.h), which results in the code/data being placed in specific sections. The section mismatch analysis is always performed after a full kernel build, and enabling this option causes the following additional steps to occur: - Add the option -fno-inline-functions-called-once to gcc commands.   When inlining a function annotated with __init in a non-init   function, we would lose the section information and thus   the analysis would not catch the illegal reference.   This option tells gcc to inline less (but it does result in   a larger kernel). - Run the section mismatch analysis for each module/built-in.o file.   When we run the section mismatch analysis on vmlinux.o, we   lose valuable information about where the mismatch was   introduced.   Running the analysis for each module/built-in.o file   tells where the mismatch happens much closer to the   source. The drawback is that the same mismatch is   reported at least twice. - Enable verbose reporting from modpost in order to help resolve   the section mismatches that are reported.
SCHED_DEBUG;If you say Y here, the /proc/sched_debug file will be provided that can help debug the scheduler. The runtime overhead of this option is minimal.

SQUASHFS_DECOMP_MULTI;By default Squashfs uses a single decompressor but it gives poor performance on parallel I/O workloads when using multiple CPU machines due to waiting on decompressor availability.  If you have a parallel I/O workload and your system has enough memory, using this option may improve overall I/O performance.  This decompressor implementation uses up to two parallel decompressors per core.  It dynamically allocates decompressors on a demand basis.

CGROUP_HUGETLB;Provides a cgroup controller for HugeTLB pages. When you enable this, you can put a per cgroup limit on HugeTLB usage. The limit is enforced during page fault. Since HugeTLB doesn't support page reclaim, enforcing the limit at page fault time implies that, the application will get SIGBUS signal if it tries to access HugeTLB pages beyond its limit. This requires the application to know beforehand how much HugeTLB pages it would require for its use. The control group is tracked in the third page lru pointer. This means that we cannot use the controller with huge page less than 3 pages.

The BCM can be 'programmed' via the BSD socket API and informs you on demand e.g. only on content updates / timeouts. You probably want to use the bcm socket in most cases where cyclic CAN messages are used on the bus (e.g. in automotive environments). To use the Broadcast Manager, use AF_CAN with protocol CAN_BCM.
SND_VIA82XX_MODEM;Say Y here to include support for the integrated MC97 modem on motherboards with VIA chipsets.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called snd-via82xx-modem.
NET_VENDOR_EMULEX;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about Emulex cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.

Users can use sysfs to ascertain useful information about the running kernel, such as the devices the kernel has discovered on each bus and which driver each is bound to. sysfs can also be used to tune devices and other kernel subsystems.  Some system agents rely on the information in sysfs to operate. /sbin/hotplug uses device and object attributes in sysfs to assist in delegating policy decisions, like persistently naming devices.  sysfs is currently used by the block subsystem to mount the root partition.  If sysfs is disabled you must specify the boot device on the kernel boot command line via its major and minor numbers.  For example, root=03:01 for /dev/hda1.  Designers of embedded systems may wish to say N here to conserve space.

In order to use it you may take a look at Serial ATA (prod) and Parallel ATA (experimental) drivers.  The IDE driver (which you are currently configuring) supports a few first-generation SATA controllers.  In order to eliminate conflicts between the two subsystems, this config option enables the IDE driver's SATA support. Normally this is disabled, as it is preferred that libata supports SATA controllers, and this (IDE) driver supports PATA controllers.  If unsure, say N.

SMSC37B787_WDT;This is the driver for the hardware watchdog component on the Winbond SMsC37B787 chipset as used on the NetRunner Mainboard from Vision Systems and maybe others.  This watchdog simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze, and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of time.  Usually a userspace daemon will notify the kernel WDT driver that userspace is still alive, at regular intervals.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called smsc37b787_wdt.  Most people will say N.

SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC;The SCSI Parallel Interface-2 Standard defines 5 classes of transfer rates: FAST-5, FAST-10, FAST-20, FAST-40 and FAST-80.  The numbers are respectively the maximum data transfer rates in mega-transfers per second for each class.  For example, a FAST-20 Wide 16 device is able to transfer data at 20 million 16 bit packets per second for a total rate of 40 MB/s.  You may specify 0 if you want to only use asynchronous data transfers. This is the safest and slowest option. Otherwise, specify a value between 5 and 80, depending on the capability of your SCSI controller.  The higher the number, the faster the data transfer. Note that 80 should normally be ok since the driver decreases the value automatically according to the controller's capabilities.  Your answer to this question is ignored for controllers with NVRAM, since the driver will get this information from the user set-up.  It also can be overridden using a boot setup option, as follows (example): 'ncr53c8xx=sync:12' will allow the driver to negotiate for FAST-20 synchronous data transfer (20 mega-transfers per second).  The normal answer therefore is not to go with the default but to select the maximum value 80 allowing the driver to use the maximum value supported by each controller. If this causes problems with your SCSI devices, you should come back and decrease the value.  There is no safe option other than using good cabling, right terminations and SCSI conformant devices.
RTC_DRV_RP5C01;If you say yes here you get support for the Ricoh RP5C01 timekeeping chip. It is used in some Amiga models (e.g. A3000 and A4000).  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called rtc-rp5c01.

USB_U132_HCD;The U132 adapter is a USB to CardBus adapter specifically designed for PC cards that contain an OHCI host controller. Typical PC cards are the Orange Mobile 3G Option GlobeTrotter Fusion card. The U132 adapter will *NOT* work with PC cards that do not contain an OHCI controller.  For those PC cards that contain multiple OHCI controllers only the first one is used.  The driver consists of two modules, the ftdi-elan module is a USB client driver that interfaces to the FTDI chip within ELAN's USB-to-PCMCIA adapter, and this u132-hcd module is a USB host controller driver that talks to the OHCI controller within the CardBus cards that are inserted in the U132 adapter.  This driver has been tested with a CardBus OHCI USB adapter, and worked with a USB PEN Drive inserted into the first USB port of the PCCARD. A rather pointless thing to do, but useful for testing.  It is safe to say M here.  See also <http://www.elandigitalsystems.com/support/ufaq/u132linux.php>

MEDIA_TUNER_M88RS6000T;Montage M88RS6000 internal tuner.
MTD_BLOCK;Although most flash chips have an erase size too large to be useful as block devices, it is possible to use MTD devices which are based on RAM chips in this manner. This block device is a user of MTD devices performing that function.  At the moment, it is also required for the Journalling Flash File System(s) to obtain a handle on the MTD device when it's mounted (although JFFS and JFFS2 don't actually use any of the functionality of the mtdblock device).  Later, it may be extended to perform read/erase/modify/write cycles on flash chips to emulate a smaller block size. Needless to say, this is very unsafe, but could be useful for file systems which are almost never written to.  You do not need this option for use with the DiskOnChip devices. For those, enable NFTL support (CONFIG_NFTL) instead.

The slave device behaves identical to a physical terminal. the master device is used by a process to read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers and xterms.  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme has a number of problems, including security.  This option enables these legacy devices. on most systems, it is safe to say N.
CAIF_SPI_SYNC;Putting the next command and length in the start of the frame can help to synchronize to the next transfer in case of over or under-runs. This option also needs to be enabled on the modem.

PNPBIOS;Linux uses the PNPBIOS as defined in Plug and Play BIOS Specification Version 1.0A May 5, 1994 to autodetect built-in mainboard resources (e.g. parallel port resources).  Some features (e.g. event notification, docking station information, ISAPNP services) are not currently implemented.  If you would like the kernel to detect and allocate resources to your mainboard devices (on some systems they are disabled by the BIOS) say Y here.  Also the PNPBIOS can help prevent resource conflicts between mainboard devices and other bus devices.  Note: ACPI is expected to supersede PNPBIOS some day, currently it co-exists nicely.  If you have a non-ISA system that supports ACPI, you probably don't need PNPBIOS support.

SPI slaves connected to a bus using this driver are configured as usual, except that the spi_board_info.controller_data holds the GPIO number for the chipselect used by this controller driver.  Note that this driver often won't achieve even 1 Mbit/sec speeds, making it unusually slow for SPI.  If your platform can inline GPIO operations, you should be able to leverage that for better speed with a custom version of this driver. see the source code.
LGUEST_GUEST;Lguest is a tiny in-kernel hypervisor.  Selecting this will allow your kernel to boot under lguest.  This option will increase your kernel size by about 10k.  If in doubt, say N.  If you say Y here, make sure you say Y (or M) to the virtio block and net drivers which lguest needs.

SBC_FITPC2_WATCHDOG;This is the driver for the built-in watchdog timer on the fit-PC2, fit-PC2i, CM-iAM single-board computers made by Compulab.  It`s possible to enable watchdog timer either from BIOS (F2) or from booted Linux. When Watchdog Timer Value enabled one can set 31-255 s operational range.  Entering BIOS setup temporary disables watchdog operation regardless to current state, so system will not be restarted while user in BIOS setup.  Once watchdog was enabled the system will be restarted every Watchdog Timer Value period, so to prevent it user can restart or disable the watchdog.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called sbc_fitpc2_wdt.  Most people will say N.
MUSB_PIO_ONLY;All data is copied between memory and FIFO by the CPU. DMA controllers are ignored.  Do not choose this unless DMA support for your SOC or board is unavailable (or unstable).  When DMA is enabled at compile time, you can still disable it at run time using the use_dma=n module parameter.

The module will be called synclink_cs.  If you want to do that, say M here.
FLATMEM_MANUAL;This option allows you to change some of the ways that Linux manages its memory internally.  Most users will only have one option here: FLATMEM.  This is normal and a correct option.  Some users of more advanced features like NUMA and memory hotplug may have different options here. DISCONTIGMEM is a more mature, better tested system, but is incompatible with memory hotplug and may suffer decreased performance over SPARSEMEM.  If unsure between Sparse Memory and Discontiguous Memory, choose Discontiguous Memory.  If unsure, choose this option (Flat Memory) over any other.

IrDA-USB support the various IrDA USB dongles available and most of their peculiarities.  Those dongles plug in the USB port of your computer, are plug and play, and support SIR and FIR (4Mbps) speeds.  On the other hand, those dongles tend to be less efficient than a FIR chipset.  Please note that the driver is still experimental.  And of course, you will need both USB and IrDA support in your kernel...
COMEDI_ADQ12B;Enable MicroAxial ADQ12-B daq and control card support.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called adq12b.
BLK_DEV_RAM_COUNT;The default value is 16 RAM disks. Change this if you know what you are doing. If you boot from a filesystem that needs to be extracted in memory, you will need at least one RAM disk (e.g. root on cramfs).
MTD_SPEAR_SMI;This enable SNOR support on SPEAR platforms using SMI controller
SPI_XCOMM;Support for the SPI-I2C bridge found on the Analog Devices AD-FMCOMMS1-EBZ board.

It enables a system with a standard Ethernet adapter to interoperate with a RoCE adapter or with another system running the RXE driver. Documentation on InfiniBand and RoCE can be downloaded at www.infinibandta.org and www.openfabrics.org. (See also siw which is a similar software driver for iWARP.)  The driver is split into two layers, one interfaces with the Linux RDMA stack and implements a kernel or user space verbs API. The user space verbs API requires a support library named librxe which is loaded by the generic user space verbs API, libibverbs. The other layer interfaces with the Linux network stack at layer 3.  To configure and work with soft-RoCE driver please use the following wiki page under configure Soft-RoCE (RXE) section:  https://github.com/linux-rdma/rdma-core/blob/master/Documentation/rxe.md

MARVELL_PHY;Currently has a driver for the 88E1011S
PANEL_LCD_HWIDTH;Most LCDs use a single address bit to differentiate line 0 and line 1. Since some of them need to be able to address 40 chars with the lower bits, they often use the immediately superior power of 2, which is 64, to address the next line.  If you don't know what your LCD uses, in doubt let 16 here for a 2x16, and 64 here for a 2x40.
PINCTRL_MSM8960;This is the pinctrl, pinmux, pinconf and gpiolib driver for the Qualcomm TLMM block found in the Qualcomm 8960 platform.

Enabling this plugin reports the complexity to stderr during the build. It mainly serves as a simple example of how to create a gcc plugin for the kernel.
TCP_CONG_BBR;BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) TCP congestion control aims to maximize network utilization and minimize queues. It builds an explicit model of the the bottleneck delivery rate and path round-trip propagation delay. It tolerates packet loss and delay unrelated to congestion. It can operate over LAN, WAN, cellular, wifi, or cable modem links. It can coexist with flows that use loss-based congestion control, and can operate with shallow buffers, deep buffers, bufferbloat, policers, or AQM schemes that do not provide a delay signal. It requires the fq (Fair Queue) pacing packet scheduler.
DRM_BOCHS;Choose this option for qemu. If M is selected the module will be called bochs-drm.
IPMI_DEVICE_INTERFACE;This provides an IOCTL interface to the IPMI message handler so userland processes may use IPMI.  It supports poll() and select().
INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_X;If you're using a digitizer, or a graphic tablet, and want to use it as a mouse then the mousedev driver needs to know the X window screen resolution you are using to correctly scale the data. If you're not using a digitizer, this value is ignored.
INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_Y;If you're using a digitizer, or a graphic tablet, and want to use it as a mouse then the mousedev driver needs to know the X window screen resolution you are using to correctly scale the data. If you're not using a digitizer, this value is ignored.

NET_IFE_SKBPRIO;
HAVE_DYNAMIC_FTRACE;See Documentation/trace/ftrace-design.txt
PM_STD_PARTITION;The default resume partition is the partition that the suspend- to-disk implementation will look for a suspended disk image.   The partition specified here will be different for almost every user.  It should be a valid swap partition (at least for now) that is turned on before suspending.   The partition specified can be overridden by specifying:        resume=/dev/<other device>   which will set the resume partition to the device specified.   Note there is currently not a way to specify which device to save the suspended image to. It will simply pick the first available swap  device.
RTC_DRV_CPCAP;Say y here for CPCAP rtc found on some Motorola phones and tablets such as Droid 4.
MFD_SPMI_PMIC;This enables support for the Qualcomm SPMI PMICs. These PMICs are currently used with the Snapdragon 800 series of SoCs.  Note, that this will only be useful paired with descriptions of the independent functions as children nodes in the device tree.  Say M here if you want to include support for the SPMI PMIC series as a module.  The module will be called qcom-spmi-pmic.
SND_CS4281;Say Y here to include support for Cirrus Logic CS4281 chips.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called snd-cs4281.

IrLAN emulates an Ethernet and makes it possible to put up a wireless LAN using infrared beams.  The IrLAN protocol can be used to talk with infrared access points like the HP NetbeamIR, or the ESI JetEye NET.  You can also connect to another Linux machine running the IrLAN protocol for ad-hoc networking!
NET_VENDOR_ALLWINNER;If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y here.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the questions about Allwinner cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
NVRAM;If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/nvram with major number 10 and minor number 144 using mknod (man mknod), you get read and write access to the extra bytes of non-volatile memory in the real time clock (RTC), which is contained in every PC and most Ataris.  The actual number of bytes varies, depending on the nvram in the system, but is usually 114 (128-14 for the RTC).  This memory is conventionally called CMOS RAM on PCs and NVRAM on Ataris. /dev/nvram may be used to view settings there, or to change them (with some utility). It could also be used to frequently save a few bits of very important data that may not be lost over power-off and for which writing to disk is too insecure. Note however that most NVRAM space in a PC belongs to the BIOS and you should NEVER idly tamper with it. See Ralf Brown's interrupt list for a guide to the use of CMOS bytes by your BIOS.

OLPC_XO1_PM;Add support for poweroff and suspend of the OLPC XO-1 laptop.
CLEANCACHE;Cleancache can be thought of as a page-granularity victim cache for clean pages that the kernel's pageframe replacement algorithm (PFRA) would like to keep around, but can't since there isn't enough memory.  So when the PFRA evicts a page, it first attempts to use cleancache code to put the data contained in that page into transcendent memory, memory that is not directly accessible or addressable by the kernel and is of unknown and possibly time-varying size.  And when a cleancache-enabled filesystem wishes to access a page in a file on disk, it first checks cleancache to see if it already contains it. if it does, the page is copied into the kernel and a disk access is avoided. When a transcendent memory driver is available (such as zcache or Xen transcendent memory), a significant I/O reduction may be achieved.  When none is available, all cleancache calls are reduced to a single pointer-compare-against-NULL resulting in a negligible performance hit.  If unsure, say Y to enable cleancache

It should be noticed that keeping both GHES and a hardware-driven error mechanism won't work well, as BIOS will race with OS, while reading the error registers. So, if you want to not use Firmware first GHES error mechanism, you should disable GHES either at compilation time or by passing ghes.disable=1 Kernel parameter at boot time.  In doubt, say 'Y'.

The guests must have the virtio_transport.ko driver loaded to use the virtio-vsock device.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called vhost_vsock.
SQUASHFS_FRAGMENT_CACHE_SIZE;By default SquashFS caches the last 3 fragments read from the filesystem.  Increasing this amount may mean SquashFS has to re-read fragments less often from disk, at the expense of extra system memory.  Decreasing this amount will mean SquashFS uses less memory at the expense of extra reads from disk.  Note there must be at least one cached fragment.  Anything much more than three will probably not make much difference.

When active, these messages can have a significant impact on the speed of the driver, and the size of your syslog files! When inactive, they will have only a modest impact on performance.
BLK_DEV_UBD_SYNC;Writes to the virtual block device are not immediately written to the host's disk. this may cause problems if, for example, the User-Mode Linux 'Virtual Machine' uses a journalling filesystem and the host computer crashes.  Synchronous operation (i.e. always writing data to the host's disk immediately) is configurable on a per-UBD basis by using a special kernel command line option.  Alternatively, you can say Y here to turn on synchronous operation by default for all block devices.  If you're running a journalling file system (like reiserfs, for example) in your virtual machine, you will want to say Y here.  If you care for the safety of the data in your virtual machine, Y is a wise choice too.  In all other cases (for example, if you're just playing around with User-Mode Linux) you can choose N.

ACPI-WMI is a proprietary extension to ACPI to expose parts of the ACPI firmware to userspace - this is done through various vendor defined methods and data blocks in a PNP0C14 device, which are then made available for userspace to call.  The implementation of this in Linux currently only exposes this to other kernel space drivers.  This driver is a required dependency to build the firmware specific drivers needed on many machines, including Acer and HP laptops.  It is safe to enable this driver even if your DSDT doesn't define any ACPI-WMI devices.

NILFS2_FS;NILFS2 is a log-structured file system (LFS) supporting continuous snapshotting.  In addition to versioning capability of the entire file system, users can even restore files mistakenly overwritten or destroyed just a few seconds ago.  Since this file system can keep consistency like conventional LFS, it achieves quick recovery after system crashes.  NILFS2 creates a number of checkpoints every few seconds or per synchronous write basis (unless there is no change).  Users can select significant versions among continuously created checkpoints, and can change them into snapshots which will be preserved for long periods until they are changed back to checkpoints.  Each snapshot is mountable as a read-only file system concurrently with its writable mount, and this feature is convenient for online backup.  Some features including atime, extended attributes, and POSIX ACLs, are not supported yet.  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the module will be called nilfs2.  If unsure, say N.
SLIP;Say Y if you intend to use SLIP or CSLIP (compressed SLIP) to connect to your Internet service provider or to connect to some other local Unix box or if you want to configure your Linux box as a Slip/CSlip server for other people to dial in. SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) is a protocol used to send Internet traffic over serial connections such as telephone lines or null modem cables. nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same purpose.  Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP around (available from <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If you plan to use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The NET-3-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to configure SLIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just want to run term (term is a program which gives you almost full Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on some Internet connected Unix computer.

SND_OMAP_SOC_AMS_DELTA;Say Y  if you want to add support  for SoC audio device  connected to a handset and a speakerphone found on Amstrad E3 (Delta) videophone.  Note that in order to get those devices fully supported,  you have to build  the kernel  with  standard  serial port  driver  included  and configured for at least 4 ports.  Then, from userspace, you must load a line discipline #19 on the modem (ttyS3) serial line.  The simplest way to achieve this is to install util-linux-ng  and use the included ldattach  utility.  This  can be  started  automatically  from  udev, a simple rule like this one should do the trick (it does for me):       ACTION==add, KERNEL==controlC0, \                       RUN+=/usr/sbin/ldattach 19 /dev/ttyS3

Use of ioctl calls to the MPT driver requires that you create and use a misc device node ala: mknod /dev/mptctl c 10 240  One use of this ioctl interface is to perform an upgrade (reflash) of the MPT adapter firmware.  Refer to readme file(s) distributed with the Fusion MPT linux driver for additional details.  If enabled by saying M to this, a driver named: mptctl will be compiled.  If unsure whether you really want or need this, say N.

As a side note, saying Y here will automatically boost HZ to 1000 so that the timer has a chance to clear the overflow counter. On slower systems (such as the SH-2 and SH-3) this will likely yield some performance issues. As such, the WDT should be avoided here unless it is absolutely necessary.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called shwdt.

This is an alternative to using CRDA for defining regulatory rules for the kernel.  Using this option requires some parsing of the db.txt at build time, the parser will be upkept with the latest wireless-regdb updates but older wireless-regdb formats will be ignored. The parser may later be replaced to avoid issues with conflicts on versions of wireless-regdb.  For details see:  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/Regulatory  Most distributions have a CRDA package. So if unsure, say N.

MTD_REDBOOT_PARTS;RedBoot is a ROM monitor and bootloader which deals with multiple 'images' in flash devices by putting a table one of the erase blocks on the device, similar to a partition table, which gives the offsets, lengths and names of all the images stored in the flash.  If you need code which can detect and parse this table, and register MTD 'partitions' corresponding to each image in the table, enable this option.  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver for your particular device. It won't happen automatically. The SA1100 map driver (CONFIG_MTD_SA1100) has an option for this, for example.

Example: Inject netdevice mtu change error (-22 = -EINVAL)  # cd /sys/kernel/debug/notifier-error-inject/netdev # echo -22 > actions/NETDEV_CHANGEMTU/error # ip link set eth0 mtu 1024 RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be called netdev-notifier-error-inject.  If unsure, say N.
FB_TFT_AGM1264K_FL;Framebuffer support for the AGM1264K-FL LCD display (two Samsung KS0108 compatible chips)

I2C_MUX;Say Y here if you want the I2C core to support the ability to handle multiplexed I2C bus topologies, by presenting each multiplexed segment as a I2C adapter.  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module will be called i2c-mux.
SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS;Tagged command queuing is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves performance: the host adapter can send several SCSI commands to a device's queue even if previous commands haven't finished yet. Because the device is intelligent, it can optimize its operations (like head positioning) based on its own request queue. Some SCSI devices don't implement this properly. if you want to disable this feature, enter 0 or 1 here (it doesn't matter which).  The default value is 8 and should be supported by most hard disks. This value can be overridden from the boot command line using the 'tags' option as follows (example): 'ncr53c8xx=tags:4/t2t3q16/t0u2q10' will set default queue depth to 4, set queue depth to 16 for target 2 and target 3 on controller 0 and set queue depth to 10 for target 0 / lun 2 on controller 1.  The normal answer therefore is to go with the default 8 and to use a boot command line option for devices that need to use a different command queue depth.  There is no safe option other than using good SCSI devices.
XEN_MCE_LOG;Allow kernel fetching MCE error from Xen platform and converting it into Linux mcelog format for mcelog tools

RCU_EXPERT;This option needs to be enabled if you wish to make expert-level adjustments to RCU configuration.  By default, no such adjustments can be made, which has the often-beneficial side-effect of preventing make oldconfig from asking you all sorts of detailed questions about how you would like numerous obscure RCU options to be set up.  Say Y if you need to make expert-level adjustments to RCU.  Say N if you are unsure.
ATM_ENI_BURST_RX_8W;Burst eight words at once in the receive direction. This may work with recent PCI chipsets, but is known to fail with older chipsets, such as the Intel Neptune series.

Note that support for FlashPoint is only available for 32-bit x86 configurations.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called BusLogic.
NR_CPUS;This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this kernel will support.  If CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is enabled, the maximum supported value is 8192, otherwise the maximum value is 512.  The minimum value which makes sense is 2.  This is purely to save memory - each supported CPU adds approximately eight kilobytes to the kernel image.
IIO_BUFFER_DMA;Provides the generic IIO DMA buffer infrastructure that can be used by drivers for devices with DMA support to implement the IIO buffer.  Should be selected by drivers that want to use the generic DMA buffer infrastructure.
GIGASET_BASE;Say M here if you want to use the USB interface of the Gigaset base for connection to your system. This will build a module called bas_gigaset.
SQUASHFS_DECOMP_SINGLE;Traditionally Squashfs has used single-threaded decompression. Only one block (data or metadata) can be decompressed at any one time.  This limits CPU and memory usage to a minimum.
RESET_SUNXI;This enables the reset driver for Allwinner SoCs.
PPS_CLIENT_GPIO;If you say yes here you get support for a PPS source using GPIO. To be useful you must also register a platform device specifying the GPIO pin and other options, usually in your board setup.

In addition, user-space Kerberos support should be installed.  If unsure, say Y.
CAN_XILINXCAN;Xilinx CAN driver. This driver supports both soft AXI CAN IP and Zynq CANPS IP.
KMEMCHECK;This option enables tracing of dynamically allocated kernel memory to see if memory is used before it has been given an initial value. Be aware that this requires half of your memory for bookkeeping and will insert extra code at *every* read and write to tracked memory thus slow down the kernel code (but user code is unaffected).  The kernel may be started with kmemcheck=0 or kmemcheck=1 to disable or enable kmemcheck at boot-time. If the kernel is started with kmemcheck=0, the large memory and CPU overhead is not incurred.
MTD_NAND_BF5XX_HWECC;Enable the use of the BF5XX's internal ECC generator when using NAND.

MCS_FIR;Say Y or M here if you want to build support for the MosChip MCS7780 IrDA-USB bridge device driver.  USB bridge based on the MosChip MCS7780 don't conform to the IrDA-USB device class specification, and therefore need their own specific driver. Those dongles support SIR and FIR (4Mbps) speeds.  To compile it as a module, choose M here: the module will be called mcs7780.
BLK_WBT_MQ;Enable writeback throttling by default on multiqueue devices. Multiqueue currently doesn't have support for IO scheduling, enabling this option is recommended.
8xxx_WDT;This driver is for a SoC level watchdog that exists on some Freescale PowerPC processors. So far this driver supports: - MPC8xx watchdogs - MPC83xx watchdogs - MPC86xx watchdogs  For BookE processors (MPC85xx) use the BOOKE_WDT driver instead.
DVB_USB_RTL28XXU;Say Y here to support the Realtek RTL28xxU DVB USB receiver.
DISCONTIGMEM_MANUAL;This option provides enhanced support for discontiguous memory systems, over FLATMEM.  These systems have holes in their physical address spaces, and this option provides more efficient handling of these holes.  However, the vast majority of hardware has quite flat address spaces, and can have degraded performance from the extra overhead that this option imposes.  Many NUMA configurations will have this as the only option.  If unsure, choose Flat Memory over this option.
SI7020;Say yes here to build support for the Silicon Labs Si7013/20/21 Relative Humidity and Temperature Sensors. This driver also supports Hoperf TH06 Humidity and Temperature Sensor.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called si7020.

BCM63XX_PHY;Currently supports the 6348 and 6358 PHYs.
INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_NONE;Do not compress the built-in initramfs at all. This may sound wasteful in space, but, you should be aware that the built-in initramfs will be compressed at a later stage anyways along with the rest of the kernel, on those architectures that support this. However, not compressing the initramfs may lead to slightly higher memory consumption during a short time at boot, while both the cpio image and the unpacked filesystem image will be present in memory simultaneously

SND_PPC;Support for sound devices specific to PowerPC architectures.
ACPI_EC_DEBUGFS;Say N to disable Embedded Controller /sys/kernel/debug interface  Be aware that using this interface can confuse your Embedded Controller in a way that a normal reboot is not enough. You then have to power off your system, and remove the laptop battery for some seconds. An Embedded Controller typically is available on laptops and reads sensor values like battery state and temperature. The kernel accesses the EC through ACPI parsed code provided by BIOS tables. This option allows to access the EC directly without ACPI code being involved.

USB_EHCI_HCD;The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB 2.0 high speed (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller hardware. If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to configure this Host Controller Driver.  EHCI controllers are packaged with companion host controllers (OHCI or UHCI) to handle USB 1.1 devices connected to root hub ports.  Ports will connect to EHCI if the device is high speed, otherwise they connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host Controller Driver or UHCI (for Via motherboards) Host Controller Driver too.  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/ehci.txt>.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ehci-hcd.

DM_CACHE_SMQ;A cache policy that uses a multiqueue ordered by recent hits to select which blocks should be promoted and demoted. This is meant to be a general purpose policy.  It prioritises reads over writes.  This SMQ policy (vs MQ) offers the promise of less memory utilization, improved performance and increased adaptability in the face of changing workloads.
APB_TIMER;APB timer is the replacement for 8254, HPET on X86 MID platforms. The APBT provides a stable time base on SMP systems, unlike the TSC, but it is more expensive to access, as it is off-chip. APB timers are always running regardless of CPU C states, they are used as per CPU clockevent device when possible.
PCIEAER_INJECT;This enables PCI Express Root Port Advanced Error Reporting (AER) software error injector.  Debugging PCIe AER code is quite difficult because it is hard to trigger various real hardware errors. Software based error injection can fake almost all kinds of errors with the help of a user space helper tool aer-inject, which can be gotten from:    http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/pci/aer-inject/
PWM_LPSS_PLATFORM;The platform driver for Intel Low Power Subsystem PWM controller.  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called pwm-lpss-platform.

SND_SOC_INTEL_BYTCR_RT5640_MACH;This adds support for ASoC machine driver for Intel(R) Baytrail and Baytrail-CR platforms with RT5640 audio codec. Say Y if you have such a device. If unsure select N.
ARM_EXYNOS5440_CPUFREQ;This adds the CPUFreq driver for Samsung EXYNOS5440 SoC. The nature of exynos5440 clock controller is different than previous exynos controllers so not using the common exynos framework.  If in doubt, say N.
IP6_NF_MANGLE;This option adds a `mangle' table to iptables: see the man page for iptables(8).  This table is used for various packet alterations which can effect how the packet is routed.  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
NOMMU_INITIAL_TRIM_EXCESS;The NOMMU mmap() frequently needs to allocate large contiguous chunks of memory on which to store mappings, but it can only ask the system allocator for chunks in 2^N*PAGE_SIZE amounts - which is frequently more than it requires.  To deal with this, mmap() is able to trim off the excess and return it to the allocator.  If trimming is enabled, the excess is trimmed off and returned to the system allocator, which can cause extra fragmentation, particularly if there are a lot of transient processes.  If trimming is disabled, the excess is kept, but not used, which for long-term mappings means that the space is wasted.  Trimming can be dynamically controlled through a sysctl option (/proc/sys/vm/nr_trim_pages) which specifies the minimum number of excess pages there must be before trimming should occur, or zero if no trimming is to occur.  This option specifies the initial value of this option.  The default of 1 says that all excess pages should be trimmed.  See Documentation/nommu-mmap.txt for more information.
IP_VS;IP Virtual Server support will let you build a high-performance virtual server based on cluster of two or more real servers. This option must be enabled for at least one of the clustered computers that will take care of intercepting incoming connections to a single IP address and scheduling them to real servers.  Three request dispatching techniques are implemented, they are virtual server via NAT, virtual server via tunneling and virtual server via direct routing. The several scheduling algorithms can be used to choose which server the connection is directed to, thus load balancing can be achieved among the servers.

If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
DSCC4_PCISYNC;Due to Etinc's design choice for its PCISYNC cards, some operations are only allowed on specific ports of the DSCC4. This option is the only way for the driver to know that it shouldn't return a success code for these operations.  Please say Y if your card is an Etinc's PCISYNC.
FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL;The kernel source tree includes a number of firmware 'blobs' that are used by various drivers. The recommended way to use these is to run make firmware_install, which, after converting ihex files to binary, copies all of the needed binary files in firmware/ to /lib/firmware/ on your system so that they can be loaded by userspace helpers on request.  Enabling this option will build each required firmware blob into the kernel directly, where request_firmware() will find them without having to call out to userspace. This may be useful if your root file system requires a device that uses such firmware and do not wish to use an initrd.  This single option controls the inclusion of firmware for every driver that uses request_firmware() and ships its firmware in the kernel source tree, which avoids a proliferation of 'Include firmware for xxx device' options.  Say 'N' and let firmware be loaded from userspace.

The bus supplies power to peripherals and allows for hot swapping.  Up to 127 USB peripherals can be connected to a single USB host in a tree structure.  The USB host is the root of the tree, the peripherals are the leaves and the inner nodes are special USB devices called hubs. Most PCs now have USB host ports, used to connect peripherals such as scanners, keyboards, mice, modems, cameras, disks, flash memory, network links, and printers to the PC.  Say Y here if your computer has a host-side USB port and you want to use USB devices.  You then need to say Y to at least one of the Host Controller Driver (HCD) options below.  Choose a USB 1.1 controller, such as UHCI HCD support or OHCI HCD support, and EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support except for older systems that do not have USB 2.0 support.  It doesn't normally hurt to select them all if you are not certain.  If your system has a device-side USB port, used in the peripheral side of the USB protocol, see the USB Gadget framework instead.  After choosing your HCD, then select drivers for the USB peripherals you'll be using.  You may want to check out the information provided in <file:Documentation/usb/> and especially the links given in <file:Documentation/usb/usb-help.txt>.

UNIX98_PTYS;A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to a physical terminal. the master device is used by a process to read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers and xterms.  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later, however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx. the number of the pseudo terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.  All modern Linux systems use the Unix98 ptys.  Say Y unless you're on an embedded system and want to conserve memory.

WARNING: Be careful while enabling this option on production systems, because userland can easily disable the thermal policy by simply flooding this sysfs node with low temperature values.
NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_HASHLIMIT;This option adds a `hashlimit' match.  As opposed to `limit', this match dynamically creates a hash table of limit buckets, based on your selection of source/destination addresses and/or ports.  It enables you to express policies like `10kpps for any given destination address' or `500pps from any given source address' with a single rule.

XEN_BALLOON_MEMORY_HOTPLUG;Memory hotplug support for Xen balloon driver allows expanding memory available for the system above limit declared at system startup. It is very useful on critical systems which require long run without rebooting.  Memory could be hotplugged in following steps:    1) target domain: ensure that memory auto online policy is in      effect by checking /sys/devices/system/memory/auto_online_blocks      file (should be 'online').    2) control domain: xl mem-max <target-domain> <maxmem>      where <maxmem> is >= requested memory size,    3) control domain: xl mem-set <target-domain> <memory>      where <memory> is requested memory size. alternatively memory      could be added by writing proper value to      /sys/devices/system/xen_memory/xen_memory0/target or      /sys/devices/system/xen_memory/xen_memory0/target_kb on the      target domain.  Alternatively, if memory auto onlining was not requested at step 1 the newly added memory can be manually onlined in the target domain by doing the following:        for i in /sys/devices/system/memory/memory*/state. do \         [ `cat $i` = offline ] && echo online > $i. done  or by adding the following line to udev rules:  SUBSYSTEM==memory, ACTION==add, RUN+=/bin/sh -c '[ -f /sys$devpath/state ] && echo online > /sys$devpath/state'
SCSI_EATA_PIO;This driver supports all EATA-PIO protocol compliant SCSI Host Adapters like the DPT PM2001 and the PM2012A.

In this filesystem, the kernel driver core maintains device nodes with their default names and permissions for all registered devices with an assigned major/minor number. Userspace can modify the filesystem content as needed, add symlinks, and apply needed permissions. It provides a fully functional /dev directory, where usually udev runs on top, managing permissions and adding meaningful symlinks. In very limited environments, it may provide a sufficient functional /dev without any further help. It also allows simple rescue systems, and reliably handles dynamic major/minor numbers.  Notice: if CONFIG_TMPFS isn't enabled, the simpler ramfs file system will be used instead.
X86_DIRECT_GBPAGES;Certain kernel features effectively disable kernel linear 1 GB mappings (even if the CPU otherwise supports them), so don't confuse the user by printing that we have them enabled.
